"Nowadays many companies conduct interviews before hiring their employees. it is also said that interview is not a reliable method. 

Because it is related to the company's employees. So there are a lot of methods. 

     On the one hand, nowadays we know that there are more and more different types of campaigns and the like. And they definitely need skilled workers. Because companies cannot achieve anything without skilled workers. And so they always look for the best. And this is done through interviews. I think this is important. Because it is necessary to interview someone before sending them, and this is important. Through this the test of how well the new employees is suitable for the company plays and important role. 

        On the other hand, there are other ways to do it. For example. First, the vacancy is announced and what documents are required. It also says that intetviuvs is an unreliable method. This may be true. Because the companies that use the method are using lies. Because they are only limited to interviews. No other documents are required. And this is definitely not a good direction.

      In conclusion, I agree with this statement. Because conversation is not a reliable method and everyone understands it differently. And I think it's better to use other methods.",4,"""Because it is related to the company's employees."": Fragment

"It is undeniable that most well-known organizations prefer interviews as methods of recruiting new employees. However, others propound that they are not sophisticated procedure for doing so. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that there are other ways to select the right persons for their companies. 

On the one hand, it is considered by many that interviewing is reliable. To explain this further, it allows employers to get to know their potential candidates; moreover, sets of questions and criterias are well prepared before the process of interviews, which is convenient and saves a amount of time. For instance, those candidates may be asked about their backgrounds or occupational experiences, so they can be assessed from their attitudes as well. However, this cannot gaurantee that who can thrive in company success or reach the teams' projects as long as they start working. 

On the other hand, there are some other useful methods to hire someone. First and foremost, internship is though to be one of the most effective ways when it comes to offer someone's an employment opportunitiy. To put it simply, if interns are able to achieve some tasks given by a manager or a director, they are likely to fit in the firm. Another way to employ someone is to let them demonstrate a particular mission related to their positions, which will result in not only a better quality of their qulifications but also proficiency.

In conclusion, even though a myriad of companies rely heavily on interviews before hiring employees, there are more reliable and practical processes to recruit new staff. From my perspective, I argue the notion that interviews are the optimal way to hire someone.",4,"""To explain this further, it allows employers to get to know their potential candidates; moreover, sets of questions and criterias are well prepared before the process of interviews, which is convenient and saves a amount of time."": Fragment ""However, this cannot guarantee that who can thrive in company success or reach the teams' projects as long as they start working."": Run-on",,
"In modern world, traditionally, in order to get a job in a good place, people need to go through a series of interviews. This practice is quite universal and many companies use it. Despite everything, this method has a number of disadvantages and advantages. However,  inspite of the advantages, I think  this is a good approach.

 

Advocates of this believe that today at the time, when a huge number of people are fighting for equality and diversity, universal approach  to recruiting can be the key to the successful business. Another good thing of interviews is HR specialist should not to prepare to examine every candidate  separately. It makes the prosess  of recruiting simplier and faster.  And finaly, the third reason why interviews are a fine practice is possible future emloyees can make ready and answer some common question before an face-to-face communication and it helps people to be more confident and relaxed during the interview.

 

There are, however, some disadvantages. Common approch for recruiting may not take into account the personal qualities of job applicant. Talented but timid  person may suffer from such interview where he or she will feel uncomfortable. Another bad thing in the interview is monotony. A lot of people say the same thing day after day. Either because it is taught in the courses, or because humans  think that it will be better if they say common phrases, however it often happens that a person goes through a dozen intervies in different companies, but does not find a job.

 

In my opinion, there are may be a better ways of tackling this problem. For instance, HR specialists can approach recruiting in more personalized way. Every person is unique and if the company wants to be a cool,  modern and succesfull, then this company should take into account the capabilities of each person working in it. In the end, happy people work much better.",4,"""Despite everything, this method has a number of disadvantages and advantages."" : Fragment ""However, inspite of the advantages, I think this is a good approach."":run-on ""This practice is quite universal and many companies use it."": fragment

"The success of any business depends on the quality of it's staff and recruiting new employees can be a long and painful process. There are multifarious approaches so that I agree with given statement. This essay intends to analyze methods of hiring new employees.

Unquestionably, an interview is an important recipe of recruitment. It requires a detailed understanding of the organizational needs as well as a careful grasp of the prospective employee's responses. However, an employer can not fully access a candidate's capabilities, personality or charach during an interview. Sometimes, a candidate who possesses better qualifications may fail to get the job because of his poor performance in the interview. This system would be fruitful, when the recruitment is a small scale and only a few employees are needed.

There are many other methods, which can be employed to hire personnel. In my opinion, interviews should not be the only criterion for selecting candidates. It should be used in conjunction with written tests during which a candidate's proficiency and knowledge in various subjects can be assessed. In addition, candidates should be asked to participate in debates or group discussions. Their real personality and leadership skills will come on the floor during these events. After this, it is important to check the reference to ascertain the authenticity of what is written in the resume.

Analysing the above mentioned methods, it is inevitable that no single method is perfect. Each job has its own requirements. Qualification is more significant for some jobs and other requires experience. External recruitment agencies can be assigned the task for searching for suitable candidates for jobs, but it may be very expensive. However, I believe that spending on the recruitment of new employees can prove to be good investment, as good personnels can breathe new life into your business.

"Nowadays, the production of goods is increasing considerably, and is causing a series of problems to the nature. This essay will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon, and also the possible solutions.

There are two main reasons related to the impact of production to the environment. One of these is because of the lack of environmental regulations to protect the nature. It is well known that our rules do not support all aspects related to the damage caused by production in large scale. For instance, there are numerous industries in São Paulo that through their gabage in the river, and nothing happens. Furthermore, the industries do not invest in developing new technologies to make their processes more efficient, and more environmental friendly.

However, there are solutions to this issue. Firstly, the government should apply more taxes to those companies that do not respect environmental regulations. For example, the rules applied in Brazil are too soft when compared to developed countries like Canada. Another important point is that we should have more aducation actions focused on environmental solutions that would make our industrial process greener. For instance, universities should invest in researches to increase the manufacturing efficiency.

In conclusion, the absence of laws and regulations to protect the nature against the impact of production, and also the lack of technology to improve efficiency, are the key aspects of the problem. Nevertheless, if the government apply regulations focused on environmental actions, and also invest in technology, this situation could be solved.",4,"""It is well known that our rules do not support all aspects related to the damage caused by production in large scale."": choppy

"Some people argue that if the poructs will many sell, that the natural would have damge by the production.I strongly believe that people's little action can decrease the damage.

Nowadays, the number of the damage increasing have a lot of reasons. The product increase to sell. That is mean the products pakages incresed too. Almost pakages are consist of pollution such as plastics, vynls. For example, smartphone make new version around by every year in several companies.So, people buy the new smartphone by every year include pakages and components too. The phone selling figure will be over 1 million in one year. As result, we have many charging line and other component. That is do not useful everywhere. At that time, they will be the pollution. The pollution goes to natural. that is negative effect reasons. 

However, if the companies try to change their selling products simple packages. And, if that product's components will be consist of more simple. The pollustion would be significantly decrease. And, we should try to reclyle their pakages shch as papers and plactics. Also, old devices should reclyle too. Although that is a small action, that effet is very big spectially for the natural environment. The companies and people both should try to decrease damage to the natural.The natural have rent by them  who the future children. Therebefore, we should use to careful the natural.

"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in there areas. The burgeoning in the manufacture of customer goods outcome in damage to the natural surroundings. In my perspective, this essay will explicate some of its causes as well as some problems to solve this matter. 

To commence with, there are the predominant causes first one is. Pollution demand. To explain it, most of the people who are living in the society and other streets they use a plastic polythene, and when they buy from  the market when they finish their packet they through on the road, nor they do not put into the dustbine. However, it might occur some kind of unsaftyness of the masses. In other words, when the garbage collector comes in the street to pick the waste material they go to the cabinet store to through all these waste products and then they and then they do fire on it after that pollution is create around the areas. Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack. Secondly, the main point is that less opportunities of job available in the factory. It means, if customers do not comes in the factory or shop to buy the garments so the owner of the factory will loss their sales in daily routine. Moreoso, if new fresher comes to the shop for job vacancy and the manager of the shop says their is no available and also they give a less salary to employees who working in the shop.

On the other hand, there are some Of the Tribble to solve this matter. To explain it, government should take high funds from the people and also provid some awareness and campaigned programs among society persons. In other words, there should be hight panelty to consumer goods who are doing these things. 

To recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit.",4,"""To commence with, there are the predominant causes first one is.

"In recent years, an increase in the manufacture of consumer goods has been seen. While this is connected to population growth, it has resulted in an increase in a detrimental effect to the environment. In this essay I will look at 2 possible causes for this as well as suggest some solutions. 

Due to the extreme high volumes of manufacturers in order to meet the increasing demand of products, there has been an increase in factory produced CO2 gases. This is because the manufacturing processes have not become more efficient as quantities have risen. In China for example, many new factories have sprung up over the last few decades resulting in huge quantities of pollution being fed into the air. If factories were to spend funding on researching more efficient manufacturing processes, the amount of polluted air would be decreased. Manufacturers in their numbers, should concentrate on reducing CO2 production. 

With the increase of factory workers, there has been a matching increase in the transportation of these workers to the facilities. In addition to this, there is an obvious rise in the transportation of products, all of which has resulted in higher Carbon gas emissions form vehicles involved in the process. The number of busses and trucks carrying labourers to and products from the factories in China have added to the already polluted atmosphere in the country. Improved and more efficient vehicles using no fossil fuels, such as in electric vehicles, or less fuel will improve this situation. Transportation accounts for a large percentage of the worlds total carbon gas production.

While it is understandable that we need more manufacturing facilities for the ever-increasing world population, we need factories who take environmental issues seriously. Factory management need to ask themselves the question, ""are we doing enough to minimize our carbon footprint?",4,"""The number of busses and trucks carrying labourers to and products from the factories in China have added to the already polluted atmosphere in the country.""run-on ""Manufacturers in their numbers, should concentrate on reducing CO2 production."" choppy While it is understandable that we need more manufacturing facilities for the ever-increasing world population, we need factories who take environmental issues seriously.

"It is true that the rapid growth in manufacturing of goods is causing serious damage on our environment. This essay will discuss the factors causing this issue followed by solutions to tackle it.

There are several reasons contributing to this problem. First, the lack of regulation assciated to the quality of air emited from chimnies and waste mixed into natural rivers allow factories to generate greenhouse gas and industrial pollutant to the environment, as a result rise the temperature and eliminate both marine and terrestrial species. Meanwhile, the production of goods is most dependent on nonrenewable power. In fact, oil and fossil fuels are imperative in maintaining the energy of vehicles to run and machines to operate, though release a huge amount of pollutant, causing catastrophic natural disasters such as flood and tornado.

To alleviate this issue, the government should impose stringent laws to assess each factory's infection level of emission and take sanctions to companies that damage the environment. A large amount of fine or even imprisonment can serve as deterrent to prevent pollution. At the same time, the government can practice renewable resources that are clean and healthy for nature, such as wind power and solar power to replace the traditional eco-unfriendly resources.

As discussed above, industrialization is adversely impact our environment because of the absence of regulation and technology, but we can address this difficulty by enforcing appropriate methods.",4,"""As discussed above, industrialization is adversely impact our environment because of the absence of regulation and technology, but we can address this difficulty by enforcing appropriate methods."": fragment ""First, the lack of regulation assciated to the quality of air emited from chimnies and waste mixed into natural rivers allow factories to generate greenhouse gas and industrial pollutant to the environment, as a result rise the temperature and eliminate both marine and terrestrial species."": run-on ""Meanwhile, the production of goods is most dependent on nonrenewable power.

"Due to the expansion of consumer goods , it is showing negative impact on nature. There are many reasons behind this harm, in this esssay we will discuss those reasons and prospective solutions for that.
                                Consumer goods are those products which are available for ready to use to consumer. The product can be used for a minute to long time. In present senario when modern technology is devloping very fast, customers are provided with a vast range of consumer goods. In way to satisfy the risen demand from consumer side,there is mass exploitatin of natural resources from producer site. There are many things like plastic , harmful metals and other packaging materials are used in these factories. The factories are also harming the environment by adding polluted water, dangerous gases and hazardus waste to surroundings.
                            Due to mass production we are damaging our environment, resulting in air, water and soil pollution.
Production of the goods can not be stopped suddenly but we can restrict it. Fot this government can make policies which keep eyes on producer of the goods. Awareness programme amoung public and industrialist should be run to make them educate about side effects of this kind of growth. Consumer should be informed in details about the damage which is caused by a single consumer product to nature, so they can also minimize their demand or avoid the demand of products which are not necessory.
                          Every development comes with it's pros and cons, so we can not stop moderisation but we can make peace between development and environment.

"Thesedays, the highly increase in producing of consumption goods has impacted to the natural environment. In my opinion, it can be attributed to several reasons and a number of solutions should be conducted to tackle this problem.
First of all, the population of the world in some countries has increased rapidly. Therefore, the demands of consumer goods that people have to spend a lot of their money to buy these products for their daily necessity. For instance, they use cleaning products such as detergent to wash their dress and clothes, soap for taking a shower. Moreover, one the biggest threats to the environment is waste we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans because the consumption goods have become the most important items in human life and the less aware of littering, so people usually throw trash in publics such as bottle of plastic and nylon bag.
Secondly, government could make more effort to reduce waste. They should introduce laws to limit waste from factories or companies and force households to use renewable energy from solar, water power. By the way, the personal encouragement limits to use palstic bag which choose products with less packaging and recycle as much as possible. Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for customers for recycling glass, plastic and paper in our the environmental life.

"Polluted environment is an ongoing dilemma in the modern world these days and it is conspicuous to see that increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. Tackling this issue is challenging, especially given the speed of social change and the pressure of modern life. Therefore, this essay will explicate some key reasons why environment is polluted and will suggest a range of possible measures that can be taken to improve/change the situation and highlight probable knock-on effects of polluted environment. 

A wide range of reasons can be put forward to elaborate why the environmental pollution caused by produce consumer goods. Perhaps, one can definitely assert that lot of companies did not treat the drainage properly. The industrial waste of a monosodium glutamate factory called Ajinomoto can be taken as an example. To demonstrate, because the modern drainage was not installed by this company, and they threw all the industrial waste into the water causing water pollution in this area. Thus, it is no surprise to see that there is rise in producing consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

Improvements to polluted environment can be achieved in a variety of ways, strict management of dischargement is one of the most favourable and note-worthy choice. To elaborate, government should be controlled strictly and only allow which company to have environmental protection standards so they never can throw their trash which are harmful to the environment into the atmosphere. This can improve the situation by controlling the amount of industrial waste to environment and encouraging recycle waste. Thus, while there can be other steps to be taken, this can be considered to be a good start towards declining the damage to the natural environment caused by manufacturing consumer goods.",4,"""A wide range of reasons can be put forward to elaborate why the environmental pollution caused by produce consumer goods."" fragment ""The industrial waste of a monosodium glutamate factory called Ajinomoto can be taken as an example.

"Many primary and secondary education students are find it challenging to focus on lectures at their educational institutes. This essays discusses the causes of this development and also suggests ways to resolve them.

Many pupils cannot maintain concentration at schools because some of those may have exisiting medical conditions, while it is also likely their daily routine is inconducive for learning. I was suffering from ADHD, attention deficit hyperactive syndrome, which is known to distract students easily who often complain about their inability to lose focus for prolonged period of time. Hence, I believe that it is possible that such syndrome may be undiagnosed in many disciplines, which could explain their lacking power of concentration. As well as this, habits that are disruptive, such as playing excessive hours on video gaming and spending less time in outdoor active, also contribute to this problem.

However, this challenge can be overcome by increasing awareness. Parents need to be aware any underlying medical conditions so that its repercussions could be averted. Therefore, the government can use public infomercials to educate the parents about any health conditions that could undermine their children' ability to concentrate. As well as this, an information broadcast aimed at enlightening fathers and mothers about the benefits of exercising and supervising children's screen time, , such as watching cartoons and digital games, could mitigate the problem. For example, playing outdoors not only increases dopamine but also increases alertness.

"Not being able to focus on the class is one of the inherent characteristics of children in their learning journeys. In my point of view, this can attribute to two main reasons: mismatched learning method and development of game industry. This article will explain the reasons and give corresponding solutions.

It is irrefutable that we learn differently. Some obtain knowledge through read a lot while others prefer to listen to lectures. However, there is a prevalence among most of the countries nowadays, such that children are taught in the same way. In other words, schools today fail to provide every student the environment that conducive to learning. Consequently, since children dislike what is imposed on them, they no longer pay attention to the classes in school. Furthermore, considering the advance of technology, game industry is thriving nowadays. As a result, mobile games are creeping into our daily life. Consequently, since more toddlers are more incline to play rather than study, such games might act as a strong distraction in children’s studies.

However, things are more complicated in the first case than the second one. In the first case, in order to keep toddler concentrate, we must make them enjoy the environment of learning at school. In other words, we must encourage and help every child to develop a learning style that fit the most. This involves long time communication with parents and teachers. In the second case, on one hand, parents must control the amount of time that their children have spent on mobile or computer games thereby minimize the negative influence that such games have on toddlers. On the other hand, game companies should introduce real-name system to prevent children from playing some highly addictive games like PUBG and CSgo.

To conclude, the unfitted learning style and the development of electronic games are the major factor contribute to poor focus in class. Parents and game companies should do their best to help.",4,"""To conclude, the unfitted learning style and the development of electronic games are the major factor contribute to poor focus in class.""fragment ""Consequently, since children dislike what is imposed on them, they no longer pay attention to the classes in school."": run-on ""In my point of view, this can attribute to two main reasons: mismatched learning method and development of game industry.""

"Some professionals argue that for wealthy countries, increasing their level of economics will not result in satisfied citizens. I agree that rich countries can't provide more satisfaction for their people just increasing economics. My take on this is that citizens achieving a basic level of life will need to be more interested in education or environment improvement. On the other hand, rich country not always mean wealthy people.

In a developed country with steady economics, people tend to worry more about social problems either economics. It is common, when the basic level of needs is covered, citizens start to improve to the next level of well-being. Some people would be more interested in developing education, some would attempt to improve the ecological situation in a country or even in the world. For instance, if the family already has all necessary for regular life, including house, car and medical insurance. The yield of this average family is high, they can afford a lot of things to themself. But it's often on that stage that owing new stuff or devices don't bring happiness.

In contrast to citizens who already have all to cover base level needs, it is still possible that in a very developed and rich country we can find poverty-stricken people. From my point of view, there is no rich country in the world which solves the problem of indulgent people. Even if economics is steadily growing, we can easily find people that are not satisfied with their life.

"Nowadays we live in the era of immediacy where people's patience runs easily.This phenomenon is mainly to  the revolution of technology. which I think in my opinion is a positive development.

To begin with, The advancement of technology had made our lives much  easier and more convenient.

while technology had played a vital role in making services instantly available there are some pros and cons for this shift. The major merit of this phenomenon is that it created more jobs in the customer service industry. Major companies are training and haring more and more people in order to produce fast and complete services such as concierge.However, one of the drawbacks of this shift is that people have become so dependent on technology and the fast services that it provide for us to point out that any delay on any services will make them irritable anxious and angry. which will lead to bad and unpolite behaviour.For example, and this is an incident that I have wetness on my own eyes a man was shouting at a coffee barista because he had to wait for a few minutes to get his coffee because the coffee machine was not working.

"Climate change is the greatest threaten to the existence of life on earth. Some people suggest that seeking a way to go along with climate change outwiligh prevention of it. Personally, I strongly agree this view and believe we should take bolder action towards it.

Firstly, climate change is detrimental. Researches have proved that climate change will lead to destroy current and future human civilisation. Melting of glaciers and rising of sea level will cause several problems. Due to that problem people will emigrate and lose usefull lands and their homeland. Similarly, extreme weather which has become more frequent in causing droughts. For example, due to defostration quality of air getting worst. Concequently, there will be no plau for us to survive if we dont take steps.

Global warming is the main cause of climate change. If both people and governments tak usefull steps to protect this issue, this can be controlled to be great extent. For example, the governmens should stop the generation of power from fossil fuels which cause more carbon emissions and increase global warming. In addition, green energy as a wind, solar and hydropower can inversted by government.

To conclude, it is clear that global warming and climate change had already started and ongoing, however there is still chance to prevent this issues. Especially, we should present better climate to future generation.",4,"""To conclude, it is clear that global warming and climate change had already started and ongoing, however there is still chance to prevent this issues.""fragment ""Firstly, climate change is detrimental.

"Some people believe that we should learn to how to live in the environment that climate is changing rather than preventing it. However, I totally disagree with this view.

Actually climate change is caused by humans, so people have the responsibility to recover it. The increase of carbon dioxide is the reason why climate is becoming warmer. On the one hand, the exhaust from vehicles on the road and emissions from factories are the source of carbon dioxide. On the other hand, People cut more and more forests as well as plant less trees, leading to less carbon dioxide can be absorbed by green plants. The planet is the common home for all creatures not just for humans, people are supposed to offset mistakes they have made. Many animals cannot survive such a warm weather and become extinct, so people should take efforts to save these animals.

As climate is becoming more extreme, it is difficult to find a way to live in such environment while it is easier to take measures to prevent it. First of all, climate change will lead to many serious disasters that humans have no power to prevent. As climate becomes warmer, ice packs are melting increasingly, which leads to the rise of water level. In this way, flooding is more and more frequent now, and people lose their homes and family when flooding comes. Second, there are many measures can be taken to prevent climate change, from governments to individuals. Governments can introduce laws to restrict the number of vehicles and promote “ green taxes” on factories. Individuals can take public transportation instead of driving their own cars. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that people should make every effort to prevent climate change.",4,"""Actually climate change is caused by humans, so people have the responsibility to recover it."" fragment ""As climate becomes warmer, ice packs are melting increasingly, which leads to the rise of water level.""run-on""As climate is becoming more extreme, it is difficult to find a way to live in such environment while it is easier to take measures to prevent it."" choppy",,
"Someone believes that we shouldn’t try to avoid changes in climate, but find a solution to  cope with it instead.This essay will support this belief, giving some valid examples to this  thesis.  Firstly, thinking that we can change climate transformation is like believing that it is  something that occurred exclusively because of humans, but this isn’t true.. Mankind  populated the earth for an extremely tiny part of its life and over this time many other  climatic catastrophes have occurred, like the famous Ice-Age. This is to say, that earth  inhabitants could never play such a relevant role in its transformation. Some scientists  recently found out, from the observation of the earth layers, that it is possible to assume that  over the time, similar climatic patterns have repeated themselves, meaning that if the planet is  getting much warmer now, it might return to colder temperatures in future.  Moreover, another point is that, even if we wanted, it would be really unrealistic to believe  that we could stop our impact on earth in time. The United Nations estimate that, in order to  avoid climate change from becoming irreversible, nations should stop their emissions by  2050. This is almost impossible, since this kind of development might be reached worldwide only in a much more distant future. Just to give some examples, many industries worldwide  don’t have enough money to invest in sustainable energy and electric vehicles, so they are  still very far from becoming popular and affordable.  Furthermore, a research conducted by the University of Oslo by 2018, proved that even  though a country the size of America went completely green by that time, just around 15% of  emissions would have decreased.  To summarize, climate change cannot be stopped, so it is fundamental that governments find  solutions to coexist with it.",4,"""This essay will support this belief, giving some valid examples to this thesis."" fragment ""Firstly, thinking that we can change climate transformation is like believing that it is something that occurred exclusively because of humans, but this isn’t true.."" run-on ""Mankind populated the earth for an extremely tiny part of its life and over this time many other climatic catastrophes have occurred, like the famous Ice-Age."" — This sentence could be smoother.

"In today's time, human activities are having a dramatic effect on climate change of our planet and some people think that rather than taking measure's to prevent climate change, we should learn to live with it. I firmly disagree with this opinion and in this I will provide certain example's to back my argument.  These days, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at there highest level's since the past thousand's of years. This has caused many problems. For instance, people who live in polluted cities have difficulty in breathing, low fertility rate, lower life expectancy among infants and much more. All this combined with global warming and man made pollution has made it extremely difficult for nature to maintain it's equilibrium configration. This all amount's to drastic changes in our planet's climate and can also cause many natural habitats to go extinct. Under such circumstances, only us humans will be able to adapt to the climate changes, but not other species.  For example, consider the case of fishes. The continuous increase of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to the vapourisation of polar ice caps. This has lead to an increase in the sea levels around the world. In such circumstances, the amount of human waste deposition into the sea and oceans around the world has also increased which has led to the deaths of countless fishes in these waters. Moreover, in some instances, these fishes were found to be dead on the shore of beaches and some found to be floating dead on the surface of the water. This is just one of the few examples that goes on to show, that although humans will be able to adapt to all the climate changes and find a way to live with these changes, majority of the animal kingdom population won't be able to do the same.  So in a nutshell, instead of finding a way to live with the changing climate, one should looks for ways to minimize it.

"Since   a number of   ,years  population  from   the countryside  move to big   metropolis  for various reasons and   ,consequently  capital   center  have   a  shortage of housing. In   this  case,   the national  government is the only one to tackle   this  issue. I am fully agreed that   the governer  has the main responsibility to have sufficient housing in commercial   cities  to prevent unnecessary side   effect  . The main reason that causes the shortage of housing in   downtown  is increasing the population day by day who migrate from countryside  to work as the daily workers   ,especially  in construction sectors and many industries.   society  are moving to   center  which offer   greater employment and   a higher  standard of living.   For instance  , most of the   city's  life can access   the internet  , mobile banking,   and convenient  transportation system.   As a result  , accommodation places are more and more demanding   significantly  for   blue-collar  workers who can only afford   a low  budget   houses  .   Additionally  ,   several  side   effects  has been occurred   such  as   water  shortage and electricity   getting  by hourly.   Moreover  , accommodation and domestic   water  supply cannot be separated in urban life. If the population and urban   water  system ratio   are  not equal, there will be many  consequences  related to   people's  health   problems  ,   for example  ,   people  cannot use sufficient   water  amount for their   water  and sanitation purposes. Another particular   problem  of big city life is   having  good   practices  and management system of household waste. If the governments cannot control daily waste, the diseases   of diaherra  and flu can be spread easily. In   this  case,   people  have to spend extra charges for their health. To prevent the   problem  mentioned above, only   the head  of the nation can be solved the   problem  because they have   the responsibilities  to support to be a developed country and it requires   a huge  amount of money to build sufficient housing in   the country’s  gateway  cities",4,"The main reason that causes the shortage of housing in   downtown  is increasing the population day by day who migrate from countryside  to work as the daily workers   ,especially  in construction sectors and many industries.: Fragment

"The line graph illustrates the percentage of paper and cardboard, glass containers, plastics and aluminium cans that were recycled in the period between 1982 and 2010. Overall, it seems that paper and cardboard remain the highest recycled material while plastics stayed as the least recycled products throughout the period. 

To begin with, in 1982, the amount of paper and cardboard recycled started out at about 60%, afterwards there was a noticeable rise to 80% in the year 1992 but it later saw a steady decline to 70% in 2010. As compared with glass and containers which is the highest recycled product beginning at 50%,  1988 saw a slight dip, it subsequently rose to 70% in 2010. 

On the other hand, the two least recycled materials saw an increase over the period. Aluminium cans rose significantly from about 3% in 1982 to approximately 47% although plastics saw a minimal increase from 1% to approximately 9% at the end of the period-2010.",4,"As compared with glass and containers which is the highest recycled product beginning at 50%,  1988 saw a slight dip, it subsequently rose to 70% in 2010.: Fragment

"In recent decades, global warming has been receiving a great deal of media attention  around the world. Although the idea of co-existence with climate change appears  pausible, people should find out some feasible solutions to combat climate change instead of accepting it in the long run.  There are a number of reasons explaining for the co-existence with global warming.  First, since it is believed that natural disasters are unavoidable, trying to resist them is  hopeless. For example, Japan is particularly susceptible to earthquakes ,or some Asian  countries get hit the most by typhoons due to their geographical location, thus combating  global warming is in vain. Second, the expense of space projects is extremely high ,which  discourages people from investing it to prevent climate changes. In fact, some people  suggest that government funding should be diverted toward improving the living standard  of ordinary people in lieu of investing in space projects, which means they accept to live  with global warming.  However, it’s human’s duty to find out practical approaches to prevent climate  changes because of it negative impacts. First, climate changes is largely shaped by  human’s activities rather than the nature itself. If people don’s take responsibility for  what they have been doing to environment, natural disasters will get closer to them,  causing a big loss on human life such as global warming or frequent typhoons,...

"In the present era, money plays a  significant role in human activity.It is argued that earned cash ought not to pay to authorities instead it should be kept with oneself, while others argue that it should be paid to the state . I agree to some extent and this essay will discuss both  views.

On the one hand, individuals agree that wealth ought to keep to themselves only not paying  to the law, to fulfil their activity necessities. Moreover, life is unpredictable, saving is essential for utilizing it during emergencies such as illness .

On the other hand, some believe that people must pay their duty , assisting the government in maintaining the country's economy. For instance, the amount collected by the government from the public is used for providing transport convocation such as the maintenance of roads , bus services and railway outlines. Without these convocations, living will become very hard in high-cost economy. Thus , making payments of tariffs to authorities is important.

Furthermore, the state has to take a number of decisions related economy such that of maintenance of the health sector, which requires cash , to further carry out expenses on providing services to society, these expenditures are only met by the collected money from people. without these dawning, there will be a high-cost economic system.Therefore, it is the responsibility of the crowd to must pay their bills on time.

In conclusion, although some disagreed with the notion of paying bills to the state because of life essentials.

"Money is the main source of happiness for human being. Many people considered that after so many hard work they have earned money so they want to keep that money. Although as an aware citizen, we should keep mind to provide fair tax to our government to ensure our public services. In my opinion, I believe that every citizen should pay fair taxes. 
         Firstly, Money is everything for today’s world. This is because we can buy our necessary products from money. Without money, we couldn’t ensure our future livelihood. So people make sure that they have enough money to survive. In addition, many people think that the more they can invest the more they can accumulate in the long run. As a result, they are unwilling to lose money through the deduction of tax.
       In contrast, an aware citizen should be obliged to pay taxes to the government for number of reasons. If we pay taxes in time, we can get good highway roads, hospital facilities, parks and many other public services. With the same money, people can help to ensure the economy of country. For instance, paying the tax is a way of ensuring the comfortable livelihood.

"Owing to modernization, the rapid race to succesed has led to plethora of advertisements and promotion campaigns, highlighting their products and making it stand out from rest of the compitators. Since, Individuals go through such campaigns on regular basis there are umpteen chances of consumers getting involved and influenced. The severity of influencing and number of measures to deal with this are stated in following discussion.

To commence, the advertisements can easily influence a buyer not only into trying the noval products or experiences but also gluing people to their items on a long run. Adding to it, correct strategies for marketing can boost a product's sale to a greater extent. Moreover, advertisers and marketing agencies are using quirky and fancy ways to attract the customers, and it is paying off the hard work. To exemplify, history has seen a great case of a company influencing customers as well as making them try the product, soft drink giant Redbull, managed to catch attention of citizens just by stuffing trash cans and roads with empty redbull cans in their struggling days.

On the other side, in recent times it is utmost important to not neglect negative marketing which can influence kids as well as grown ups into doing horrifying things.

Moreover, an education on such matter can help curb the effects of some marketing stunts with demerits. However, a greater solution to this issue can be found by mitigating the compitation at local level what-so-ever, upshifting the focus of sales even on global level.

"Due to the modernization, several social, cultural and economic problems are becoming the part of the present world. Lack of affordable and stable housing is one of the major problem that has a negative impact on the wellbeing of a country. Remarkable individuals opine that solely the leaders of the country can resolve this issue. This essay will decipher the role of government and highlight apt approaches by which this problem can be sorted out.

First and foremost, authority’s role in demand and supply of housing is undisputable. Since the politics has the ultimate right in the land management with huge resources of budget. It is quite easy for authorities to build affordable inexpensive houses at a very less EMIs for low incomed people in order to meet the requirement of public housing around the cities. Moreover, higher officials can help the foreign and private sector companies to move in the rural areas so that suburban dwellers do not have to commute to the centre of the city for work, which would reduce the density of metropolis.

Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the leaders of a country to help their disadvantaged citizens to have a certain degree of standard of life. Thereby, special subsidized schemes for housing should be implemented for the poor people to provide them housing facilities at spending a little amount of money. Also, the market price has been manipulated by the foreign or private sector investors, government intervention should be in place to discourage these investors from purchasing land other than for non- residential purposes. 

To recapitulate, higher officials being the ultimate power can solve this problem and easily meet the requirement of affordable housing all round their country. Some strict implementations need to be taken to halt the global investors from occupying all the housing land.",4,Since the politics has the ultimate right in the land management with huge resources of budget.: Fragment,,

"In recent days, many people think that the best decision to claim successfulness is crawling in ladder of higher educational system, whereas others proclaim that spending the time in secondary school is enough. Yet, I believe that both of them gladly give their own impacts in positive ways. 

First and foremost, studying at university or college bring powerful effects of knowledge for students and alumnus. Firstly, relationship that build by connecting to others when we do academic or practical learning such as in daily class, weekly competition, and annual organization, will blast the linking circle of friends. For instance, as sophomores, they hardly get the essential point of study after spending in a one-year period, but they can widen up their circle through adaptation and habituation by which students can grab a lot of friends with different background of varied majors.

However, the majority of vocational schoolers already have provisions to jump into work life in which they are supported by vocational curriculum. As evidence, vocational students indeed have specific talents which are the beneficial factors to sail in work life.

On the one hand, becoming a studious person gives you a backet of knowledge and higher study is essential for become graduate.

However, School life is just a first step in everyone's life. According to some people get a job can give money and also saving time. Otherwise completing full study is benefial in everyones life. In my opinion,  updating the future can change our generation. Therefore, It is possible when we look our learning thing seriously. For instance, In many tv news, such as Jamuna tv, channel 24,  they telecast the broadcast of job interview, where every gradutive person gives their viva test.

Yes, it is true that now a days there are plenty of companies which are making same product advertise for their product.

"It is believed that there are two feasible routes to move on your academic career. Compared to getting into a university which possibly raise students' success, applying for a job after high school graduation benefits school-leavers to some extent. In my opinion, studying at university place a firm background for job appliants. This essay will elaborate both viewpoints and illumiate writer's opinion. 

    Attending to a university could benefit the young in favour of knowledge and promotion. In other words, university provides students with several academic lectures, which acts as a prerequisite for recruitment. For example, most of young newcomers to John Hunting have a university degree as the first impression to their interviewers. Moreover, if young employees have an academic qualification, therein lies a potential promotion, so they can receive more salary. For instance, managers in many big companies are the excellent graduate; therefore, they receive a bundle of money to their best ability. Personally, continuing a study process is a firm foundation for those who long for reputation and remunerative job.     

   However, the appearance of vocational school has grown as a recent trend for the young who have no momentum to vie for university. These teenagers’ similarity is to gain work experience sooner than students sitting in a university. Therefore, they are capable of bearing workplace pressure since they have been working for a long period since the graduation of students. For example, many teenagers choose to work at a babershop or business vendor for the ability of endurance. Plus, they create a connection with the community in order to open their friend circle. It is possible to get a job at an early age to expand your friend network since you have to meet other people. Taking some footballers in Vietnam as an example, they do not get into a university yet they improve their sport skills then play for their regional team. As a result, they have a multitude of relationships.

   In conclusion, both university and society could teach you much information and challenge your competency. As an exponent of academic institution, I ascertain that university plays an essential role in orientation and self-improvement.",4,"Compared to getting into a university which possibly raise students' success, applying for a job after high school graduation benefits school-leavers to some extent.: Fragment

"The great majority of people are always faced the dilemma of whether get a higher education or trying to get a job. I would say that deciding what is better for prosperous career depends on our own profession

    On the one hand, students can attain better results after practising during their university time. For instance, it is impossible to become a doctor without education or to be a pilot without knowledge as well. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that people with degree will succed later due to their specialization. As a result many doctors, engeneers, lawyers have enormous salary, though it is not everythere. If we compare countries like USA and Kazakhstan, we will see tremendous difference beetween wages

     On other hand, reason to start working after school is also tempting. In order to make many young generation starts to work immediately. It seems that because of  their rebellious nature they just want to be independent, but that's not always the case. A lot of us just don't see the point of four or more years of learning as well as passing exams and paper work. Music, IT, art and other occupations do not need educational background. To illustrate the point of this idea we need to recall the many examples of stars, inventors and other succesful people in our world. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg are good examples of such humans. Nevertheless, turning to their profession, it is obvious that without knowledge in their field, they will not achieve so unbelievable goals

    In conclusion, despite society has different views, I suppose that it would be better for all of us to choose our path independantly.

Moreover, when companies spend their budget on advertising, they also set higher price on their products. This leads people to lose their money more over.
There are many means to solve this problem. First of all, governments should control the quality and the numbers of advertisements. They should allow only advertisements showing fact information and control the number of broadcasting per day in order to help people to get real information for decision to buy products and less annoying them.

There is common belief that scientific research has more definite benefits for society, such as medical advancement, technological progress, and environmental solutions.

Furthermore, investigating on scientific research can contribute to economic growth.

For example, governments can share this research during international collaboration and receive funds or get help from other scientists on other parts of the world.

"In the contemporary era, researches are being done but the financial support to them is less then it requires. It is believed that the authorities should provide required money for scientific research rather than wasting money on less use full subjects. I agree with the above mentioned statement and the upcoming paragraphs will discuss the reasons which have shaped my opinion.

To commence with, the first and the foremost viewpoint is, scientific research needs big financial support financially to work appropriately. Moreover, these researches contribute to the economy and students welfare in studies. To substantiate it, I would like to quote an epitome that a recent survey revealed that overall 0.5 million money has been spent on the research related to useless subjects. Furthermore, if this money has been spent on science subjects, it had had great impact on education welfare.

Undoubtedly, there are other factors related to some subjects such as not all students are interested in science subject. Moreover, if other subjects enhances the creativity of mind that leads to the personality development. If the research related to other subjects rather than science would be effective than it can also contribute to the economy as mostly students prefer other political or commerce related subjects.

To recapitulate it, I believe that no doubt, science subjects are important but other subjects should not be neglected as it has its own advantages. Mainly the new generation prefers the subjects other than science as they find it difficult.",4,"It is believed that the authorities should provide the required money for scientific research rather than wasting money on less useful subjects.: Run-on

As a result the are some individuals who held the point of view  all of the funds provided for research should be given specifically for scientific research, instead supporting others type of investigations.

"In this cutting-edge era, TV becomes part of our life. Most masses believe children habits are spoiled by watching television. Others think in the favour of this, as they grow up. This essay intends to discuss  both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.

The reasons why people believe watching tv has benefits on children. Firstly, children have a hectic schedule, they spend the most time in  school and later they have to do homework which had given by their teachers then spend some time on tv by watching their favourite show gives them relaxation from the study. Secondly, many education programs telecast on the tv and watching the right kind of shows increase knowledge. Finally, some children decide their career by watching sports, food, music, and arts from the tv program. For instance, most sportspeople choose sports by watching their favourite games. Therefore, Virat Kohli is one of them and he is the greatest cricketer in  history.

Other individuals have a negative point on this. They say that children become lazy and couch potatoes by spending the most time in front of the television and the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year, in spite of this their eyesight become weak. Further, many violent and vulgar shows are broadcast on tv, which affects them mentally due to this they develop some bad habits at an early age, later this becomes a great problem in their life.

I believe that watching tv has an advantage for  toddlers. They learn many things from this such as cooking, art skills, sports, and some dance moves. Whereas, it is one of the greatest things to kill boredom in life.

To commence, television results badly on the body. In other words, there are numerous  rays emitted from the television that not only weaken the eyesight but also the neuro system. Moreover, it makes youngsters lethargic. In conventional times, during leisure time children play outdoor games which make them more active . A survey  was held in Denmark, in 2018, which revealed that the rate of diseases like obesity, burgeoning after the demand for television increase in the market.

Next to it, nowadays, television is the main source owing to which young ones behaviours inappropriately in the society. This means children brain is like a car with weak breaks but good acceleration. Furthermore, they have a habit of replication. When they watch anything on TV try to implement in their life. For instance. In ,America the rate of juvenile crime starts increasing every year after the permission given by the government to broadcast violent shows .

On the other side, the acquisition of knowledge is also an important thing. The numbers of TV channels like Discovery helps to enhance the knowledge in the field of science. Visualisation imprints children minds more than audio.Although there are many more activities to relax  it is one of them to take a break from the monotony schedule  under the observation of parents. Children do not know that what is good for them or not .So parents should monitor  that what they are watching on television.

"Celebrities are often recognised for their stardom and affluence afore than their accomplishments and this results in setting a detrimental example on the youngsters. I completely agree to this view due to many reasons which will be discussed furthermore in this essay.

Firstly, future prospects of the young individual is negatively affected because they focus on the status of their favourite celebrity without having the knowledge of the hardships they went through in order to achieve a successful position and fall into the traps of depression because they link success to the outer appearance and possessions that results to failures in their life in a run to attain comfort zone without any struggle. In other words, they fail to understand that instant stardom does not last long and are less likely to opt for hardships

Secondly, young adults consider money and fame to be the key to success. This is the reason why celebutantes have millions of followers on their social networking accounts and the youngsters are the ones who follow their life style and adapt to the materialistic environment by acquiring information about them. Not only that, they are even willing to buy a product endorsed by a celebrity .As these juvenile lack experience  they easily grasp these things in minds without knowing their life background and look ahead to enjoy a luxurious life which makes them money oriented rather gaining success through their own efforts or hardships.

To conclude, I agree that famous personality’s takeover the mindset of young people who spoil their future by trying to imitate them and consequently lead an unstable and unsuccessful life.

"It is true that most of the celebrities are known for their luxurious lifestyles than for their performance or talents these days and they can have a negative influence on youth. To a certain extent, I would agree that this kind of behaviour would be a bad example not only for young generation, but also it can be affect for the society. As we know, some of famous people can be extremely inspirational for teenagers because of their hard work.
On the one hand, it is a fact that plenty of popular people  become famous due to their fancy lifestyle, instead of their talent. Their acting talent might be standart on below the average but they are making sensation to the public by showing their glamours lifestyles. It is believed that the behaviour would be a negative influence for the youth as it teaches them about hedonistic lifestyle.
Nonetheless, there are some celebrities who can be a positive model for young adults. These people have had shown to the universe that they have reached achievements due to strong determination and hard work. Famous of the examples would be the legandary footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. They are the highest paid football players in the world because of their talent, determination and perseverance. In fact, they constantly training and working in order to create own careers. When  Messi was a child, the was poor.  After his attempts, he became world's best footballers. Therefore, both of them extremely inspirational for teenagers as they show that it is essential to fight for their dreams by being a persist human.

"Nowadays, people are more worried about there retirements. Certain people think that government should give some amount of money to them opposed to some think they should sincare about there own future. I support that government should give some pension so that they can lead a decent life i will elucidate in the following essay.

Fist of all, government should support reitred people financially as a social responsibily and ensure a comfortable and secure retirement.so that, they do have to worried about their future. For example, If government pay a pention in a monthly basis they can manage their everyday need they dont have to dependable to anyone else. Furthermore, it can reduces poverty among elderly citizens. 

On the other hand, old people should take responsibility for their own future. Additionally, they should save some money for themself so that, reduces the burden on government. Also, encourage them for saving and planning. For instance, before going to retirentment if they open a fixed deposit account in a bank and save a little amount of cash  from their salary every month at the end of their occupations they will finish with a handsome amount of money to survive. Although, they also can do some private investments.

To conclude, It is batter for them to more concern about retirement by saving money, making some investments and so on but government should take reponsibility as they serve the nation in their young ages so its time for government to take care of them in this situation.",4," As we know, some of famous people can be extremely inspirational for teenagers because of their hard work.: Fragment

"Undoubtedly, when people reach at a later stage of their lives, they need more assistance and attention.  A section of people believe it is governments duty to aid retired individuals by providing them funds  although others opine they are accountable to look after themselves. I am accord with the latter opinion  as the governments have other important domains to invest their funds. Let us delve deeper in order to  have a better understanding on these two perspectives in the impending paragraphs. To begin with, the pivotal ground behind the former opinion of considering governments must assist  retired people fiscally because they have paid a large amount of taxes during their working tenure.  To explain, when people work in different fields in their lives, they are liable to pay taxes from their  remuneration so governments ought to help them financially during their older stage. Elderly people  have worked industriously in order to bring prosperity in their country and they had worked for a longer  duration in their lives. Thereby, governments should assist senior citizens of their country financially as they had paid taxes and they had worked rigorously in their working period. To exemplify, a survey conducted by The Unites States of Census Bureau in US in 2015 on 1365 youth ranging from 25 to 35 years old revealed 94% of them agreed governments were responsible to helped retired people financially as they had paid them taxes from their wages regularly and they had worked hard so that their country was able to make progress.  On the contrary, the main reason for the latter opinion of considering retired people should take care of  themselves is that it makes them feel more self-reliant. To clarify, as people before reaching at the elderly stage had always looked after themselves, they never got dependent on anyone for their needs so this has developed a feeling of self-independent in them. In order to maintain the feeling of self-sufficient, it is pivotal for the senior citizens not to be dependent on the governments for the monetary aspect. To illustrate , a research conducted by Harvard University in 2017 on 4580 retired people ranging from 75 to 88 years old revealed 97% of were contented that they were not dependent on the governments for finance and they were living their live indpendently in their later stage too.  To encapsulate, it can be concluded, although retired people had paid taxes during their working period,  they must not be dependent on governments for finance. I wholeheartedly believe retired people should take care of themselves in order to maintain their feeling of self-sufficient and governments have  already other areas to invest funds for nation development.",4,"Let us delve deeper in order to have a better understanding on these two perspectives in the impending paragraphs.: Fragment

"An array of people believe that retired people shall be supported by government and not left to their own meager resources. While other think that they should take care of themselves. Meanwhile, in forthcoming paragraph both view and opinion will be ellaborated. 

The foremost reason many support government backed retirement plan is the dire condition of senior citizen. There are numerous reason deserving the attention. Some elder people are without shelter and staying on foothpath, some may be war veterants and having trouble in finding jobs due to their physical and psychological inpairments,other still may be  victims of economic downturns. Without support they must get mercy of socities and wind up in soup kitchens and seeking for chronic charity or even begging.

"Youth plays a vital role in the growth of many nations . Today most countries reported a dramatic increase in the younger generation compared to the older ones. This essay will discuss the causes that going to account in present and future for a country because of this development.

First of all, the younger generation can make a lot of changes to a nation because they are  really  energetic and smart. To elaborate , if the younger population increases it will lead to economic growth in a nation. It is obvious that the outsourcing of foreign companies from various regions will become more interested  to open new branches in the country to acquire more talented and creative employees so that they can enhance the productivity of the corporates. Therefore, corporates provide huge salary packages to gravitate younger minds to the institution for different vacancies . Hence, it will lead to changes in the infrastructure of the cities in the nation by accounting a significant variation in every sector such as transport , health and education , eventually , it owing to a sudden rise in  economic growth.

However, in the future , the current belief and cultures of the nations will  innovate when the younger  generation  recognise other traditions are more exciting and fun than their current  culture. Thereby, it will change the entire custom , laws and lifestyle of the country . Consequently , creating new beliefs and traditions in countries. For example, in India living together custom was seen as a crime in the early days ,  Whereas nowadays the law has completely changed  by allowing citizens to do  so. In ,addition unemployment could be major and could be a major  problem for nations to concern more , because every individual will be highly educated and talented in every profession . Thereby , it will lead to huge completion in every work sector, as a  result , major people.will be unemployed in the future.

"Some demographic surveys have shown that the proportions of young people are rising rapidly. This may  be because of any reasons such as illiteracy and poverty or wars or any other reasons. This essay shall delve   into the immediate and long-term outcomes of this trend on those countries.     The most important current impact of such a trend would be on the national economy. For instance, goods   and services would need to be imported, which would lead to an unstable economy. ln addition to the effects on economy, there would be social implications also. The young population has lot of energy, which  must be channelized in the right direction, or it would lead to crime and violence in society. The  government will have to invest a lot on educational institutes, as more children need more schools andcolleges. ln addition more spending on health would also be needed.   lf careful management of such a situation is done by the government, for instance, by providing good  education and health facilities, then the future outcomes could be quite positive. The long-term result   would be that the education and health infrastructure would be well developed. The society would be   younger and more vibrant. The culture of those countries would be more fast-paced than the traditional   culture  However, in case the present time is not managed nicely, then the future effect would be different as there   would be more people within the country needing employment. Then there might arise the problem of  unemployment. Unemployment invariably leads to petty crime and violence.  Summing up, the long-term effects of having more young people, depends on how the situatiorr is handled   today. lf handled well, the culture and lifestyle of these countries would be transformed if the population   would be younger.

"Nowadays numerous huge firms allocate an interview form as the basic choosing criteria. Whereas, a group of the public believe that this form is no longer up-to-the-minute and companies should not rely on them as some significant methods have developed in order to be a better choice for recruiting someone. I agree with the opinion that the employment process can reap the benefits of new methods so as to the right selection.

It is my view that, from an industrial perspective, make effective communication plays a vital role in a company’s prosperity. Therefore, having excellent interpersonal skills are more invaluable than anything else. Not only does it make a customer to be gulled to that firm and a great opportunity to make more profit but also provides a tranquil atmosphere at the workplace which results in more job satisfaction and boosts the efficiency of the employees. Hence, interview forms are not capable to illustrates this feature of a person. For example, people who do not excel at writing a letter may be ignored for a job position, although they have great communication abilities.

In contrast, some people believe that what a firm need is interview forms. They insist that applicant’s academic results are decisive factors in selecting the right person. However, I do not find this argument convincing as in this modern world experience outweighs academic learning. In addition, despite the lack of knowledge in a field, an experienced workforce can reinforce the company’s circumstances more. For example, people who have experience  selling without an academic degree are more likely to be successful compared to individuals who just hold a degree in this major.      

In a nutshell, I completely agree with making use of new methods so as to recruit a workforce because interview forms are not fully accurate and they have a lack of depicting one’s skills.",5,"""Hence, interview forms are not capable to illustrates this feature of a person."": fragment ""It is my view that, from an industrial perspective, make effective communication plays a vital role in a company’s prosperity."" run-on ""For example, people who do not excel at writing a letter may be ignored for a job position, although they have great communication abilities."" — The connection between ideas could be smoother.

"it is argued that there must be another method such as written tests, group discussions and so on rather than taking interviews. I disagree to a large extent.

When a candidate appears for group discussion he/she evolved in all sorts of situations because the company gives many kinds of situations in which they have to give their opinion, but it is a written test they got problem-solving questions which give a few stressful to their mind but it is not the appropriate method because candidate talk help from other to solve these tests.

"The recruiting process of people is the one main duty of companies. Despite this fact, some people argue that there should be other methods of hiring  candidates for the companies. I totally disagree with this statement, and  this essay, will support my point of view with the relevant arguments. 

To begin with, the interview process between employers and employees is the best method of understanding the candidate's behaviour, manner of thinking and emotional intelligence. Most Human Resources representatives are highly educated in the basics of psychology and can interpret the people who applied for the particular position and estimate the capacity to learn or contribute their knowledge to the challenges of the company. 

On the other hand, face-to-face meetings help applicants to understand the company's environment and decide to act based on the company's requests and proposals. For example, individuals, who have exact expectations and targets related to their career life, can estimate their future in a particular company and decide, do they need this position in this environment or if they should be more selective among the other opportunities. Thus, conversation in person, can be helpful for both sides.

"Recruiting new employees can be a long and painful process. Some employers conduct interviews to select new employee. I disagree with the given statement, which says that interview is not a reliable method, and other methods are better. I believe that interview is reliable method, but there are many other methods which are equally good, and the choice is on the recruiters as to which method they find suitable for their need.

 

There are many reasons why interview is preferred by some employers for hiring new employees. Firstly, by the interview the recruiters can get an idea about the personality and social skills of the potential employees. In interviews, there are face-to-face interactions and the candidates have to answer impromptu questions, from which personality traits can be judged. Also, by asking some case study type questions, employees can judge traits like ability to handle pressure, confidence, and ability to think outside the box.

 

However, there are many other selection methods with varied advantages. One of the common methods is written test. This method is preferred when the focus on judging the theoretical knowledge of the person. Another conventional method is group discussion. This method is good where basic job requirement of the company is conversational skills for instance jobs. Group discussion can be determining the convincing power of an individual. Last but not the least, there can be combination of all three methods like written tests, followed by group discussion and finally interview. This method is the most through of all the methods checking everything from personality traits to knowledge and also communication ability.

 

It is evident that different methods have different advantages and the most method cannot be singled out. It depends upon the situation. For example, interviews asses a person's individual traits better whereas written example in an area. There are shortcomings of every method too for example there is a chance of personal bias interviews. The combination of methods can take too long to select a candidate and may be too expensive to conduct for small companies.

With an interview, a confidence level of candidates in check. An employer can judge the candidates' general information from the interview. Moreover, the employer also gets a chance to know the employee's way of talking, whether he handles a job pressure or not. Many criteria are measures with the interview. 

On the other hand, I personally believe that there are also other factors which are necessary for recruitment. The testing of logical reasoning, mathematics, general knowledge, technical knowledge and so on. In IT companies, theoretical knowledge is compulsory because, most of the work is theory base like send an e-mail to the client. For example, last week, an IT company visited my institute to hire employees for a company. There were a totally 4 rounds. The first round was theoretical knowledge.

"Companies provide employment to the large number of people. The success of any business depends on the quality of the staff so employers conduct the interview to select new workers. Few individuals think that interview is not only a way to appoint somebody on a job. I disagree with the given statement, which says that interview is not a reliable method but there are other better methods also for hiring employee in a company.

To begin with, there are numerous reasons that why interview is being always preferred by the big enterprises; because it is a face-to-face communication where an employer who held the interview and an employee answered the questions regarding to his field. Moreover, a person who is taking the interview can easily judged the personality traits such as skills, confidence, behavior, IQ, self-awareness, self-confidence, attitude and many more. After reviewing the qualities of an interviewee the interviewer put the right person on a right job accordingly to his traits. Big companies like reliance company appointed their workers through taking an interview and accordingly to their studies it is a mention worthy example to cite over here. Hence, this is the main aspect that why interview is being preferred.

Admittedly, if face-to-face talk is not a dependable method to recruit a person on a job then there are multifarious methods which can be used to appoint an individual on a job. Firstly, written test method can be applied by the large companies for recruiting the workers in which multiple choice questions would be given to them for testing their knowledge and capability of understanding. Secondly, assessment centres would be preferred in which the team activities would be done as well as competancy based skills would be judged. It is a good paradigm to mention here is in the field of marketing these tests would be mostly applied in which employee traits can be judged. Ergo, that are some tests which are better than the interview.

From my book of experience, I think so that the face-to-face conversation is better than the other tests which are applied because in an interview a interviewer can easily judged the personal traits of the person whilst through the other tests which are applied a person can only judged about the knowledge of that person in the particular field. If a company applied both of these tests would be too expensive that a company can not conduct these to hire an employee.

For instance, some plants usually have a tendency to build more factories in developing countries such as China, India or even Vietnam, which can provide them with various modes of machines and wealth skilled labor market, resulting in helping them in many ways of manufacturing and assembling goods. 

Another method that can be mentioned is to produce constantly a lot of high-quality products with distinctive designs and colors that can catch customers’ eyes. In addition, these products can be useful for people in terms of beauty as well as use, or they can boost the businesses’ reputation. To demonstrate, thanks to the outstanding development in many aspects mentioned, Iphone becomes a typical example of the most successful electronic devices all around the world, which have strongly contributed to the corporation’s sales over the period since they were first released to the community.

In conclusion, the companies adopt strategies such as product cost reduction and constant development in order to increase sales and run their businesses more comprehensively. I believe that corporations should strike a balance between the two to reach effective results.",5,"""It is claimed that nowadays there are more and more enterprises built with many purposes, but one of the most crucial goals is to make more sales.""

"In modern life, it is irrefutable that the surge in the demand for consumer products has left detrimental effects on the natural environment. However, the central questions here are why such an adverse relationship between the increasing goods consumption and our nature has occurred, and what solutions can be executed to address this issue. The purpose of this essay is to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon and then, propose some possible measures.

To begin with, one of the primary factors resulting in the negative impacts of producing necessities excessively is its manufacturing process, which has significantly contributed to the pollution. In major cases, factories use numerous chemicals and heavy metals during their production. In addition, they also release greenhouse gases into the air and nearby water sources, which considerably harm the neighboring ecosystems, wildlife and human health. The fashion industry is a typical example of water pollution due to its dyeing and finishing of textiles. To mitigate this issue, it is advisable for governments to enforce regulations on the use of harmful chemicals and the release of emissions in goods production, as well as introduce incentive schemes to encourage manufacturers to pursue  green manufacturing practices.

Another main contributor to the natural problems is  waste generation. Currently, most  goods are made of disposal, single-use, or non-recyclable materials, which tend to gradually create waste accumulation in landfills. For instance, plastic used for packaging can persist in the environment for centuries. Therefore, the solution to this issue is for consumers to shift their consumption to recycled material and eco-friendly products. Besides, the effort should also come from the producers' side to change to more sustainable production.

In conclusion, the environmental damages were caused by several problems associated with the manufacture of the daily goods manufacture. For a long-term outcome, it generally necessitates a collaborative effort among  governments, individuals and producers to protect  nature while meeting individuals' demand for basic products.",5,"""However, the central questions here are why such an adverse relationship between the increasing goods consumption and our nature has occurred, and what solutions can be executed to address this issue.""

"Nowadays, various countries developing tend to manufacture increasingly final goods. In spite of economic improvement, producing consumer goods impacts negatively to the environment. There are noticeable causes for this problem and waste is one of the most factors leading to this issues. Therefore, it is necessary to have effective methods in order to deal with the influences of nature. 

The causes and solutions are going to be analyzed and evaluated in this essay.

First, one of the main causes why producing final goods influences to the environment is the pollution from waste. Also, the manufacturing industries need a high quantity of water to wash, clean, and operate equipment. The more water resources are used, the more additional the amount of wastewater. From that point, these wastes over-excreted result in damage to the natural environment. This problem happens regularly in retail companies because they cannot afford to invest totally in environmental protection works; however, large enterprises can have sufficient financial and resource conditions to solve with several solutions. Hence, the gorvernment should only allow facilities to build wastewater treatment systems or changing production ways by applying new systems to avoid over-excreting.

Second, another of the main causes why producing final goods influences to the environment is the emission of waste. In fact, transports such as cars are produced risingly, which cause air pollution. More broadly, the treatment of emissions is a significant issue in the world when producing consumer goods, because these companies prioritize promoting increased production instead of protecting the sky. However, there are positive ways to approach both of the mentioned goals. Users should use environmentally friendly vehicles to change to manufacture these transportations for facilities. Moreover, old products should be demolished and planned to be collected and handled properly. 

In conclusion, there are considerable causes why waste is one of the most common aspects of leading to these issues. Therefore, it is necessary to have effective solutions to handle the influences of nature.",5,"""Nowadays, various countries developing tend to manufacture increasingly final goods."" fragment

"In the present day, the natural habitat is inflicted negatively due to the rise of consumer goods manufacture. This essay attempts to identify the causes of this matter and provides a solution for diminishing the consequence to the climate.

The harm to the surroundings derives from the companies’ release of vinegar and the lack of people’s awareness. For the former, with the dramatic growth of population, more and more products have been manufactured in order to severe individual purposes in many aspects of life. This act leads to  mass production which requires enterprises to operate at full capacity to satisfy the considerable consumption of billions of people throughout the world. If those businesses are run without stopping to handle chemicals from manufacturing, these tonnes of chemicals, which contain contaminating substances, will be discharged to the rivers, and beaches which cause adversely to the water environment. Furthermore, another cause can be mentioned as the deficiency of residents’ awareness. Some people hold the view their consumption on clothing, plastic products are not sizeable so they do not need to take action to recycle after using those products for once. For that reason, their waste can be the pollutants to the surroundings from the processing methods, namely burning which results in  air pollution. For example, it is recorded that around 90 million pieces of garments are thrown away annually across the globe. 

Besides that, there is a vital solution which should be taken is to give obsolete things, especially clothing and books to  charitable organisations so that they can provide for the needy, such as the minority. Each year, there are parts of the population in the mountainous regions who are  short of clothing and education. Thus, giving old clothes, and books to charity not only reduce pollution but also helps the underprivileged community to have better lives. 

In conclusion, while the removal of vinegar from firms and the lack of awareness are the causes of goods manufacture, utilising obsolete items for charity is what could be done to alleviate the environmental problems.",5,"""In the present day, the natural habitat is inflicted negatively due to the rise of consumer goods manufacture."": fragment

"The growing in the production of consumer products outcomes in harm to the natural environment. In my opinion, there are several reasons why increase the production of consumer goods have a negative impacts on natural environment including, dofrestation, and create pollution, however, there are several meausres to address this issue namely, introduce the strict laws against dofrestation, make mandatory for companies to treat the water polluted. 

To begin with, the primary reason why raise in the production of consumer goods results in adverse  to the natural environment is deforesation. This is because  dramatic cutting down trees can lead to increase the amount of Co2 footprint in the atmosphere, because tress plays a significant role to absorb Co2 emissions from the earth. Therefore, more production of consumer goods can leads to contribute to global warming and climate change result of increase the amount greenhouse gases. Water contamination is another reason why produce more goods can lead to damage the ecosystem. This is because factories use fresh water with chemcial substance in their production process of their goods. Consequently, when factories  finish production process they release water polluated to the rivers and lake without treatment. 

On the other hand, there are several actions can taken by the government to tackle this problem. The first effective solution, the authorities should introduce harsh laws against deforesation. Furthermore, they can impose taxes in goods produce result of deforesation in order to discourage production companies to produce more goods. The second efficient solution, the government should make compolsory for companies to treat the water contaminated before release to the rivers or oceans. 

To sum up, form my perspective , there are different reasons why increase the production of consumer goods have a adverse consequences on natural environment including, dofrestation, and create pollution, however, there are several solutions to deal with  this issue namely, introduce the strict laws against dofrestation, make mandatory for companies to treat the water contaminated.",5,"""The growing in the production of consumer products outcomes in harm to the natural environment."" fragment

"The increase in production of consumer goods can cause damage to the natural environment due to several reasons. One of the main causes is the overuse of natural resources such as water, timber, and minerals. The extraction of these resources can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and pollution of water bodies.

Another cause is the use of harmful chemicals and materials in the production process. These chemicals can be released into the environment during production, use, or disposal, leading to air and water pollution, soil contamination, and harm to wildlife.

To solve this problem, there are several steps that can be taken. One approach is to promote sustainable production and consumption practices. This can be done by reducing waste, improving resource efficiency, and using renewable energy sources.

Another solution is to implement regulations and policies that limit the use of harmful chemicals and materials in production processes. This can be achieved through the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, as well as through the development of eco-friendly technologies.

Finally, raising public awareness about the impact of consumer goods on the environment can encourage individuals to make more sustainable choices in their daily lives.",5,"A sentence fragment is a group of words that doesn’t form a complete sentence.

"It is believed that as more consumer goods are manufactured more damage hass been inflicted to the environment. In my opinion, one of the reasons is the increasing demand for people consumption lead to escalate industrial waste amounts emit into the atmosphere. I believe there are lots of methods to cope with this issue.

Firstly, the world's population is increasing day by day which is one of reason for pollution. As the growth of population, it is believed that nothing can save when a human change their mind about safe their life environment. For example, according to statistics on waste in rivers in Hanoi, the industrial activities are the way to cause the water pollution by littering and low awareness that makes To Lih river one of the most polluted rivers in Hanoi. There is some solution of goods consuming, the politicians impose punishment on people who harm to the environment.

Secondly, oil expoilation is a way to deleption of natural resources. For instance, some famous brands of drink started an activity that the drink will be discounted if the costumers bring their own cuo. It can be seen that there are very good idea for reducing the goods in plastic as raise awareness for the residents with these activities will creates a good habit for people to save the community environment.

This essay will  examine some adverse effects of the increase in the production of consumer goods and then offer some measures to improve this situation.

     There are many problems resulting from the fact that  the number of consumer goods production increases. it means that these factories can discharge directly more emissions and wastes into the natural environment. for instance, some factories will through untreated sewage into rivers to save money and get more profits for factories. that is the reason why more and more rivers are polluted nowadays.

      Various measures, nevertheless, can be adopted to tackle the situation that the government should adopt some rule on processed rubish. the authorities can apply a ban on the discharge of untreated sewage and spread propaganda for everyone to know about it.

"nowadays, as we know that more and more consumer goods are manufactured, more and more damage has resulted in the environment. I will talk about two kinds of reasons why the environment is damaged and give my solution way.

First of all,  the increase in the production of consumer products harms the environment in two ways: First, because mass production of disposable goods are manufactured by industries, and people who throw away garbage don’t follow the rule to classify the garbage, this is the reason why it’s easy to see solid wastes which are found in ocrea or are found on the coastline. on the other hand, when factories manufacture products more than before, more toxic wastes and emission are released from factories into nature, those factors cause the deaths of many marine creatures. furthermore, manufacturers introduce single-use products in order to provide enough products for customers. although they can increase the products quickly, these products can remain as wastes for thousands of years.

Actions must be taken as soon as possible to minimize the negative impacts on the environment arising from the increasing amount of consumer goods. First, companies should promote the use of eco-friendlier materials. For example, the giant coffee chain Starbucks has recently replaced plastic straws with reusable alternatives made of materials like paper or bamboo. In addition, many governments are also encouraging the development of more sustainable manufacturing processes. For instance, many states in the U.S offer tax breaks and incentives for businesses using renewable energy, and some firms are even allowed to purchase green energy at cheaper prices than traditional fossil fuels.

In conclusion, there are two main reasons why the environment is severely impacted by the increase in the production of consumer goods. To address this issue, governments and companies must join hands to make the production lines more environmentally friendly by switching to greener materials.",5,"""I will talk about two kinds of reasons why the environment is damaged and give my solution way."": fragment ""First of all, the increase in the production of consumer products harms the environment in two ways: First, because mass production of disposable goods are manufactured by industries, and people who throw away garbage don’t follow the rule to classify the garbage, this is the reason why it’s easy to see solid wastes which are found in ocrea or are found on the coastline."": run-on Choppy Sentence: ""On the other hand, when factories manufacture products more than before, more toxic wastes and emission are released from factories into nature, those factors cause the deaths of many marine creatures.""

"It has been observed that organizations these days are flooding newspapers,  television by advertisements in order to survive in this bottleneck competition. Indubitably it has profound impact on people’s lives both positively and negatively.  In my perspective,  it has majorly adverse effect owing to not only promotion of throwaway culture, but also creation of financial strain. This essay will shed some light over  deleterious effects as well as pragmatic strategies to ameliorate this  exacerbating practice in upcoming paragraphs.

To embark with, owing to inevitable bombarding of marketing, end users are encouraged towards throwaway society. Since, manufacturing concerns want to survive in this cutting edge era,they tend to mislead the audience either by providing false claims or by getting their brand endorsed by figureheads, renowned personalities, celebrities and sports persons. Consequently, household budget of middle class families is disturbed as they are most likely to overspend on these items without analyzing their effectiveness. An exemplification of this could be, as per a study conducted by Canada University, 7 out of 10 advertisements telecasted on television are deceiving in nature and creates financial stress on consumer’s mind.

A number of initiatives can be taken to attenuate the deteriorating effects of adverts. The most effective step should be  close monitoring of products which are to be launched in the market by marketing regulatory body, who will inspect the item and its features so that consumers are not misguided. Adverts containing liquor or any dangerous stunts should be completely banned as youngsters tend to imitate these activities. Besides this, before purchasing any product, individuals ought to do some  research from distinct sources to know about the genuineness of what they are acquiring instead of getting swayed by the influence of their superstar.

To conclude,  it can be asserted from aforementioned arguments that although advertisements have certain limitations in the form of encouraging consumerism and adding monetary stress,  there are a couple of efficacious measures like proper screening of products to check the features so that general public can be saved from falling prey to this trap.",5,,,
"Whether it is on TV, radio or hoardings at the side of the road, advertisements have become a part of our lives. Advertising is a powerful and persuasive medium. Consumers are influenced by advertisements in both positive and negative ways. This essay shall delve into the ways adverts affect the common man and suggest ways to protect people from the negative effects of adverts.
On the positive side ads tell us about the new products that are launched in the market. They also tell us about the working of these products. After seeing the ads, consumers can go to the market and select things of their choice. On the other hand, advertisements can cause people to be dissatisfied with what they
already gave and make them want more. Being exposed again and again to products which one cannot afford leads to dissatisfaction. Furthermore, not all parents are in the position to afford the goods which the children see advertised and want to possess. This often leads to feelings of inadequacy among them. In addition to this advertisements lead to materialism and people lay too much emphasis on material goods. People are prepared to work long hours or even turn to crime to get these goods.
The solution is not simple as advertising has become a very pervasive medium. To begin with, advertisements which make false claims should be banned. Then there should be consumer awareness programmes. Consumers should be warned against too much consumerism. Finally, advertisements for liquor and those ads which show stunts should also be banned.
To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that today we are influenced a lot by adverts, both in positive and negative ways, without adverts we would lose a valuable source of revenue which is used for the benefit of majority. Our lives would be dull without these ads and there is not much that can be done against the consumerism they promote",5,,,
"In these days, the natural settings are harmed by an excessive production of goods for consumers. As a result, it can lead to extinction of natural sources like water and others. I believe that, this problem  could not be tackled wholly, but by recycling we can avoid them.

 It is obvious that, due to an increasing trends in numbers of population, healthy proportion of countries are concerning about how to heighten the goods. As an outcome, they tend to use natural sources like water for instance. This is because, in every production the role of water is crucial, but they release it back from where it was brought. In the process of cooling or heating the goods water's temperature is changed and when it is released, different temperature can affect to  death of water bodies. As a consequence, majority of fishes that cleans water from garbage will probably die out. Such scenario was witnessed in Italy by experts of ""Saving the environment of globe"" in 2010. According to its findings, water is contaminated and set the record of the World with 75% of garabge in seas, ocean and even in  channels.

 To tackle this issue, there is no need to make special infrastructure to observe abovementioned problem and from this it would not be reduced. The only way is to recycle the goods and garbage to economize the expenditures and electricity. If more reusable goods are created it opens way to follow the path under discussion. Moreover, if water is used in producing processes, it should not become redundant. It could be used in other phases, I think. As a result , more money can be invested into making high-quality goods. In China, mega factories have such strategy because of avoiding financial bankrupts.

 To conclude, environments are damaged from goods which were thrown by consumers and this can cause problematic issues. Although this is the problem which could not tackled if the World's people do not reuse materials.",5,"Fragment: ""As a result, it can lead to extinction of natural sources like water and others.""

"Nowadays, children face difficulties concentrating in school classes and their studies. There are a number of reasons why they don’t focus on studying. That, I will explain and give a solution to the problem.

There are many causes why pupils don’t pay attention to school studies. The first reason is the syllabus of the semester. To illustrate, mostly secondary or high secondary academy have more than five subjects which students find hard to memorise . The second reason is the way teachers teach them. Many offspring cannot understand what tutors teach them and find their way of teaching boring. Lastly, there are fewer enjoyable activities in academy. For example, most faculty don’t have subjects like art and drawing. That is why children cannot focus on study.

To solve this problem parents and institutes need to come forward and take some steps.

"In this contemporary era , schools and Universities play predominant role in people's life. Sometimes children face myriad of hurdles in school because of this, they can not concentrate properly. Hense, despite having muiltfarious reason behind this issue, I will give some potential measures to resolve it.


First and Paramount reason is that schools do not provide some facilities. To elaborate it, if schools do not give better amenities like smart classrooms and other equipments to students they may not pay attention in their study. An example to illustrate this point Is that an article about education in News of India in 2014 stated that some schools did not have sufficient amenities as well as other resources, because of this 70 percentage of children had difficulties in paying attention. Second and pivotal reason is that tutors pay less attention to children. To put it more simply, some teachers do not do  their job properly furthermore, they may not apply appropriate methods on students so children can not focus in schools.


Some solution can be adopted to improve the situation, one approach is that schools provide facilities to children. Since all types of amenities like smart classrooms ,computers are provided in many schools by administration, children do not have problem of concentration.In addition to this, teachers should learn some effective methods of concentration.Thus, children can definitely mitigate the problem of paying less attention.


In conclusion, it can be said that it is become difficult to concentrate for children because of absence of some essential facilities ,while providing some amenities and right guidance by teachers and schools, it is easy for children to pay attention.",5,"""Hense, despite having muiltfarious reason behind this issue, I will give some potential measures to resolve it."": fragment Run-On: ""First and Paramount reason is that schools do not provide some facilities.""

"Large amount required to spend for Olympic Games and foot ball world cup. Some support while others think that huge amount should be spent on young children to train them as sportsperson. In this essay, I strongly agree to the statement, huge amount should be spent to motivate and to shape young sports athletes.

Countries should spend enormous money for special training for the children who as eager to learn. Motivate youngsters by providing scholarships who are winning in the local competitions. They should provide well equipped facilities and amenities for sportsperson. Moreover, they have to form a successful team which contains trained coach, energetic athletes and medical practitioner. It strengthens patriotism among youngsters to serve for the country and make the country proud by winning world record.

On the other hand, organizing sports competition will economically profit for the countries. They try to show to best way to attract investors and business. It will attract many tourist to their country and it result in more foreign currency transaction. Moreover, local industry like tourism, hotels, restaurants and so forth benefited by the visitors. It increases commercial and residential development; common that people return as residents; there by demand for housing and other services. Heighten local awareness, interest resulting in a great sense of pride and ownership. It improves local community's visits a change to experience other cultures which broadens understanding.

In a nutshell, though spending money on conducting sports event will earn great revenue but investing monies for youngsters will improve sports in the country. More athletes would be motivated and win for their country and which improves status around the world and give pride and proud to their nation.",5,"Large amount required to spend for Olympic Games and foot ball world cup.: Fragment

"The issue of whether a country should spend a lot of money on these competitors has sparked off an intense debate. Some people, as advocates, suggest that huge national expenditure on supporting these competitors to take part in some worldwide sports competitions could improve the comprehensive state power. However, other as opponents claim that to spend money on children to take part in sports activities would be better than support these competitors. To a certain extent, I agree with these opponents, with some reservations. I aim at discussing both side of the issue and put up my opinion. 

On the one hand, it has well accepted that participating more sports activities could improve the health of children. However, nowadays, most of young generation locks physical excises and are reluctant to take part in sports. Accordingly, every country should implement policies to encourage and support children sports activities. For example, the government can build more sports facilities fitting for children or set up scholarship for these positive young sport participants. Consequently, when the government could spend more and more money on the children sports activities, the more benefits under the policies would address to children. 

On the other hand, spending a huge amount of money on supporting these professional competitors would encourage young children to take part in the sports. First of all, if a country has a huge expenditure on world wild professional competitions, this would directly encourage young children to be interested in sports and hope to be a professional sportman. Besides, young people would be encouraged to take part in the sports activities, when they can find that has been supported by their country. Thus, under a certain extent, I agree with these advocates to spend money on these professional sportmen, however the range of supporting should be controlled. 

To conclude, I concede that government should spend a huge amount of money on supporting children sports, when these young generation are the hope of the future. Nevertheless, I am convinced that expenditure on professional world wild sports activities are also important, and which could effectively encourage, directly or indirectly these children to participate sports.

"Some schools of thought have argued that the governing body should fend for the aged population who had served the nation in their capacity when they were young and active, while others believe that these retirees should have prepared for their retirement by building up savings during their service years. This essay agree with the former view, that the old retired citizens should by supported financially by the government rather than being left to rely on their savings when they are no longer in service. The essay will argue that these aged and dependent population are less active to take care of themselves, and that they are entitled to being rewarded by the system which they had actively contributed. It will also argue that social welfare package, like financial support when given to them, will make them have a sense of belonging.

To start with, these individuals who had served the system in their active years are justified to be rewarded by giving them financial support at the time they are retrenched from duties. This is because, at this period of their lifetimes, they are unable to work rigorously or actively like before, and as such may not be able to cater for their needs any longer. Therefore, it is just a matter of fairness on the part of the government, to compensate them, by giving them financial aids; a form of social welfare package, to enable them have quality lives. For example, by the time they retired, their income source drop dramatically, and some of them may have mounting mountains of challenges to cater for. Thus, if they are not giving assistance, they may become impoverished.

Furthermore, when the government gives them necessary support financially, they will not feel neglected or abandoned. By this means, they are able to develop sense of belonging. For instance, a growing body of knowledge has shown that at this stage of life, when they retire from active service, many of them succumb to psychological depression and this can impair the quality of their lives significantly. Thus, assisting them financially only help to improve their psychological well-being. Although, encouraging them to save actively during the service years, help them to develop the culture of saving for the rainy days, they should not be left entirely  dependent on these meagre savings for survival at this stage of life.

To conclude, I believe it is morally justified, if government plan for these special group of people in their welfare package, as they had actively contributed to the societal development in their working years.",5,"The essay will argue that these aged and dependent population are less active to take care of themselves, and that they are entitled to being rewarded by the system which they had actively contributed.: Run-on

"More and more parents are getting concerned about their children's education these days. There are several reasons why kids are not able to concentrate on their school education. This essay will be highlighting some causes and solutions to counter this growing issue.

First and foremost, most of the children do not find conventional ways of teaching promising enough to develop interest in studies. Apart from some schools, the majority of them are still teaching kids by dictation, writing on black boards and so on. Whereas the kids, who are now more familiar with the use of computers, don't find old teaching styles interesting enough to foucs on studies for a long time. This problem can be overcome by teaching kids on computers as well as making learning an enjoyable experience for them so that they can have fun and learn at the same time.

Also, with the advancement of technology, kids are more distracted from their education than ever before. For instance, majority of the children have access to smart phones, tablets and TV's in their homes, which are the biggest cause of distraction, therefore kids are not getting enough time to pay attention towards their studies. The soultion is to minimize the access of such devices and to create a schedule for a child to use these devices and for what reson as well as creating a timetable for them to study every subject during the week rather than just finishing their homework.

Conclusively, since modern problems require modern solutions so the method of teaching children should be updated in a way to engage them at highest level.

"Some researchers are thinking that when a country develops finance then all of the people living here will be feeling better and won’t want economic wealth more. I think it isn’t a good idea for some reason and I will improve it right now.

There are a lot of reasons why I disagree with this opinion. First of all, I believe that your country isn’t the richest country in the world so you think your nation doesn’t need to develop more financially is a bad idea.For example the USA is one of the most country  developing in the world, compared to another nation maybe is richer but this country never stand still position also they always want increase the average of economy then they can to be a leader of the world to help another country. This is the first reason I disagree with this idea and secondly, if your motherland has a good economy, all things like exports, imports, deliveries to another nation will be easier. You can import seafood,agriculture, very easy or maybe you can get a good price for this. Therefore, in my opinion, an increase in economic wealth is always good and convenient for citizens in all countries.

But some people agree with the idea that if the platform of economic wealth was stronged, they wouldn't want to be richer for some reason. Maybe their life was more satisfying so they want to enjoy and forget activities or don’t motivate themselves to develop for the country to increase their economy. Or  the perspective was limited then they can’t saw a long-vision in future that nation didn’t develop so all of people will have a trouble exports and imports. I think non-knowledge is the biggest reason people don’t want to be richer.

This is because with the use phone and the availability of cellular network to surf the internet, many persons can spend the whole day online without having any discussion with those in their immediate environment. For example, the result of a study performed by a prof of sociology at the college university, Lagod showed that the proportion of face-to-face discussion dropped by about 30 per cent following the invention of cellular device and the internet.

"Advancement of technology brought a massive impact on our society by obtaining services, information and tasks rapidly. I believe this has drawbacks for every individual like decreasing the essence of humanity and being an impatient person in society. 

Other people might perceive that there are fringe benefits to this advent of technology. For example, work would be simplified in every household since the availability of equipment like vacuum cleaning would swiftly finish the task, aside from this, food delivery is accessible by using a mobile phone without delays. Thus, people would get those essential needs easily in the comfort of their homes. 

However, I strongly believe that this development of technology would diminish the essence of humanity. For instance, if an online delivery would not arrive on time at the customer's front door, they were easily annoyed to the extent that they shouted at the delivery boy. Moreover, a person became immensely impatient by not obtaining services instantly because they are living in a fast pace world where they would like accessibility in just a snap of seconds. Consequently, humanity and  patience with others are slowly vanishing from each and every one.

Whereas some people refer to get things done instantly as a good development, others think upon it as a drawback and a block of revolution.

An array of reasons may lead to why finishing things instantly is a negative effect. Firstly, people who have the ability to solve the tasks persuade more effective and efficient of complete jobs.

Ancient buildings made in the era of our forefathers inculcates heritage and convey cultural values to the upcoming generation.Therefore, renovation of the buildings has become neccessity to keep the heritage alive and keep them intact so it could not demolish by any means of disaster.Moreover these can be source of tourist attractions that will ultimately boost the economy.For instance,Kate Midelton,Duchess of Cambridge Visited Pakistan  in year 2015,in an interview she stated that,she was contended to see the architecture built in USA is also present here in Pakistan which was made by their forefathers before independence,and still those buildings are intact and maintained by the government.

"Older people are important members of any society, and they require more help and attention. It is considered by some that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly, while there are others who think that it is the responsibility of individuals. I believe that the government should support the aged people. In this essay both views will be discussed before coming to a definite conclusion.  

On the one hand, a culture of saving instead of depending on the state fosters the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people have money set aside for their pension age, it would lessen the amount of financial responsibility on the government. It would allow the ministry to provide funds to the development of more essential fields, like industries, production of goods, infrastructure healthcare and education. Moreover, if all citizens knew that the state would ensure them a decent retirement fund, they would have no motivation to work hard, try to build a career and save money. In a personal aspect, saving money gives individuals a way out from uncertainties of life and an opportunity to enjoy greater security. For instance, in the case of critical emergencies, people have to deal with medical expenses and it requires a financial preparedness.  

On the other hand, old people are physically weak and are financially incapacitated. Firstly, as there is no any alternative ways of earning for elderly, their chances for employment are quite low compared to the young people. Therefore, the government should take care of aged population and support them with a monthly pension and provide a health insurance. It would allow the senior citizens to be examined and take the necessary medical care for human health. Secondly, if elderly people are left alone, they should be able to afford a domestic help and the facility of old age homes, where they can spend time with people from the same age group.  

 

To conclude, despite the fact that saving money for personal insurance has benefits not only for human’s well-being, but also for the country’s economy, I still think that government should take care of old people by supporting them financially.",5,,,
"There has been a mixed opinion on whether government should take care of old people by providing financial support after they retire or they should take care of themselves. I strongly feel that governments need to take care of the elderly people in their old age. 

Elderly people are the pillars of the society who has led their lives in shaping the future of the country. During their working years individuals have a lot on their plate to take care of like providing for the family, taking care of their parents, providing for children’s' education and etc. In addition to this, every person pays taxes as their part to develop the society. In few countries people almost pay 30% of their income as taxes to the government. 

It is the governments' responsibility to take care of their citizens at their old age. With many responsibilities on their heads, few individuals may fail fund for their retirement. In such cases governments can lend their hands to such people who have worked hard their entire lives so that they can retire peacefully. The governments can take initiatives to help these people by establishing nursing homes, providing retirement funds to employees and etc. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that all the governments should start initiatives to provide financial support to old people after they retire. This gives an assurance to the individuals regarding their retirement. This a positive development towards the economy of any country.

For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly.

In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.

In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.

In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.",5,"Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.: Fragment

"It cannot be denied that the cost of renovating old buildings is a great financial undertaking, requiring funds that could be spent elsewhere.  Whilst it is important build new housing and roads in cities, I don’t think this should be at the expense of maintaining and renovating our old buildings.

 

Our old buildings are a link to the past, part of our cultural heritage.  Replacing old buildings not only ruins the aesthetics of our cities but means some architectural styles will be lost forever.  Additionally, these buildings are important for our younger and future generations to learn about the past and a source of enjoyment as people revel in their diverse and often pleasing architecture.    

Furthermore, these buildings are also tourist attractions. They bring tourists into cities, benefitting the wider community and contributing funding to their maintenance. This contributes to the countries economies and are therefore not always such a burden to city spending budgets. Moreover, many people actively raise funds for these buildings and this should be widely publicised to encourage more members of  the local community to get involved in preserving their heritage.  

However, we cannot deny that our cities are expanding rapidly as more people move for either work or relocate from other countries.  We therefore need new housing and effective transport systems.  This should be carefully considered to avoid turning our cities into ugly concrete jungles, maybe emanating the styles of the old architecture we have in place.  Furthermore, care should be taken that the plans consider the environmental impacts so as not to damage our environment.

Overall, I think money should be spent to maintain old buildings. We need to see the bigger picture, old buildings bring in revenue, so we should assess their value to our local economies.   They are our heritage and should be maintained and new developments should complement our diverse architecture.",5,"This contributes to the countries economies and are therefore not always such a burden to city spending budgets.: Run-on

"In this day and age, climatory crisis has been of great concern to humans. With regard to this issue, some individuals hold the view that measures should be taken to acclimatize human species with this phenomenon rather than avoiding it. From my standpoint, I partly concur with this statement.

Admittedly, it is crucial that people find steps to get accustomed to shifts in global climate. This can be attributed to the fact that climate change may have come to such an irreversible point that several negative consequences can be unavoidable. As a result, steps need to be taken in order to deal with these repercussions. For example, due to the ever-increasing global temperature, there would be more extreme natural calamities such as flood or conflagration which can wreak havoc on residents’ properties and even lives. Therefore, more precise prediction systems should be invented in addition to more regular training for rescue workers and laymen in case of emergency. Moreover, it is also vital for infrastructures and buildings to be more consistent so as to shield its inhabitants during these catastrophes. Should these measures be taken into account, mortal upshots can be minimized once natural disasters occur.

Nevertheless, further efforts are still necessary with a view to preventing the deterioration of climate change. First and foremost, on the part of governments, they should impose more stringent regulations on environmental issues. Specifically, it should be made compulsory for factories to equip themselves with filtrations before releasing toxic fumes and sewage into the environment. Moreover, governmental budgets and human resources could be mobilized so as to make the most of alternative carbon-free energy. Additionally, ordinary citizens are also responsible for alleviating climate change by prioritizing public transports and other environmentally friendly means of transportation instead of personal motor vehicles so as to reduce the amount of exhaust fumes emitted into the air. As a direct consequence, the amount of greenhouse gases produced can be lessened, thereby avoiding further rises in global temperature .

In conclusion, it is my perspective that in addition to making attempts to ward off more serious climate change, humans had better find ways to accommodate themselves with some of its resultant consequences.",5,"As a direct consequence, the amount of greenhouse gases produced can be lessened, thereby avoiding further rises in global temperature.: Run-on

"Some people believe that it is better to live with climate change than to fight aginst it. I also believe that it is necessary to adapt to the whims of nature.

Climate change has been a concern of many countries for many years. Especially negative factors such as global warming and greenhouse effect in the next few years are worrying the people of the world and they are developing various measures to prevent it. Among others, we can take the Paris Convention adopted in 2015. About 200 countries are its members.

Others people think that it is better to find ways to adapt to climate change than to prevent it. Because the climate and nature have been changing for centuries, and people, animals and plants have been adapting to it. For example, as a result of global warming, there is a risk of flooding some countries. Therefore, countries should evacuate the population to higher areas and find ways to grow plants that grow in a watery environment. It is also possible to build a floating town on the water.

"Television is good entertainment for all ages. But it has pros and cons. Some people believe that it is not good to see television for children in all ways whereas others think that it helps to develop their growth. In my view, both points are true as will be explained in the following essay.

To begin with, the effects of watching television cause some major disadvantages, particularly what the subjects they are watching. For example, if they continuously watch Wrestling programs then, they tend to imitate this hence they start fighting with friends or other students in class. Moreover, these entertainments make them more addictive and become less concentrated in studies. Besides that, they will pretend to the action movies or thriller movies in their real life. Therefore, it causes very dangerous situations especially resulting in spoiling their life.

On the other hand, if children are watching good programs providing knowledge to their life and studies is beneficial. For instance, programs such as a documentary about wildlife sanctuary or travelogues about different places give vast ideas about different things. Furthermore, good entertainment is also essential for their mental development to develop thinking capability and raise their art skills. However, it is important the amount of time they are spending on this. In addition to that, language skills also can develop by watching different language programs.

To conclude, watching television is a good practice if they are used in a good manner. Nevertheless, the content and duration are predominant according to age. In my opinion, television entertainment provides positive and negative effects, apart from avoiding watching television selective programs are excellent to provide knowledge and development.",5,"On the other hand, if children are watching good programs providing knowledge to their life and studies is beneficial.: Fragment",,

"Today's modern world is highly influenced by famous personailities. Most of these people are gaining more attention by the youth for their attractiveness and money, rather than the life accomplishments they have achieved. I wholeheartedly concur with above-mentioned notion, rising importance of face value, as well as boasting personal wealth publically will prove this.

To begin with, nowadays the majority of the young populace get drawn towards the facial features of a person, especially celebrities. Owing to this, more and more individuals are trying to match themselves with the looks of these famous people. This point of view, is indirectly promoting getting a facial implant or a plastic surgery done on them to enhance their beauty. For instance, according to a survey, more than 50 per cent of the young populace undergo facial procedures regularly to look more like the celebrity they adore. 

Moreover, most of these famous persons are extemely wealthy too and they never forget to boast their expensive clothes and cars on media or various platforms. The majority of these individuals set a bad example for the nurturing populace by making them follow their costly lifestyle. To illustrate, more than two-thirds of the income generated by the young population is spent on buying expensive and luxury commodities.

Firstly, if we do not think about how to reduce our effect to the climate, we will not be able to predict for what next changes we need to be prepared. The more impact on climate we produce - the more unpredictably can be a reply from our nature. Nevertheless, some people used to blame whoever they want, in stead of themselves. 

Moreover, when someone says that we do not need to think about preventing climate change, it seems to me like exuce. To treat our planet that way - it is not fair. Humanity always need to think and evaluate the damage we produce to our nature. Because without our understanding of it, it is not possible to stop and reduce it at all.

"Nowadays, global warming is a big problem in the world and a hot topic of discussion. Some individuals think that instead of preventing from climate change problem, we need to find  methods to live with this problem. I strongly agree with this statement and I will explain my reasons for it in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, there are many ways to live with this climate change problem and can reduce it. First and foremost, individuals should use biodegradable materials for their daily uses and other purposes and boycott plastic materials, which will help us to live in a fresh climate. For example, Darjeeling, one of the districts in India, banned on use of plastic materials because it is harmful to people and damages food products. Secondly, companies should use more and more electric appliances for their manufacturing process and stop  using petrol and diesel oil, it will help individuals to live in a pollution-free environment.

Furthermore, the public should use more and more public vehicles for their work and other purposes and fewer use  private vehicles, as a result, the pollution rate will decrease significantly and people can prevent  harmful diseases like Tuberculosis and lung cancer. For example, Luxembourg  is one of the countries in the world where 90% of the public  are using public vehicles for their work and other purposes and for that reason, the pollution rate of Luxembourg is low compared to other nations.

"Nowadays, climate change is a crucial issue that it will have irreparable consequences in the future, but some communities argue that we can adapt us to these critical conditions rather than search for a way to solve and change this problem. I definitely disagree with this attitude because I believe that we still can alleviate human influences on the Earth's temperature with some beneficial solutions.

Governments and individuals play an important role to ensure the enforcement of some approaches in opposition to humidity alteration. Firstly, governments of countries especially industrial nations must introduce strict laws for minimizing carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could omit the transportation which uses fossil fuels and generalize the transportation of the green fuel such as electric cars. Secondly, allocation of “green taxes” to the companies such as airlines and other factories and investing in renewable energy systems production can be a smart solution. Finally, people can control and reduce the harmful activities that they have a serious impression on climates. For instance, they can utilize bicycles or public transportation instead of personal cars or they can select the worthy politicians who have useful plans for humidity variation control.

For example, I don’t think that individuals would be able to cope with merely increasing sea level because millions of people will lose their homes and jobs in that case, and they would try to immigrate to other adjacent countries to survive.

Nevertheless, I completely feel vice versa with the aforementioned. Due to the fact that both humans and the environment will be damaged.

To commence with, the supporters of the prior viewpoint assume that climate change and humans cannot live together due to they might be harmful.

Hence, the whole world will be yellow ( desert). Thus, a great number of animals will be victims. On an account of this, the rate of food will be diminished.

From my perspective, we need to put in efforts to mitigate this issue before it's exacerbated. I will share my viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs

To commence with, the carbon footprint should be monitored across all the nations. In other words, the government officials could impose penalties on the citizens crossing the threshold of carbon limits. Consequently, individuals would consciously change their lifestyles. For instance, for commuting, they may switch from private to public transportation. Thus, this will purge emissions in some quantities and help in tackling extreme weather issues.

Furthermore, schools should focus on  environmental studies. To elaborate on this, if adolescents are aware of the rising problems as shared by their teachers about irregular temperature then they will feel responsible towards the environment. For example, a tree plantation drive or a beach clean-up could  help teenagers to be accountable. Hence, with their mindful behaviour, preventing climate change will be easier.

"These days, celebrities are getting more fame for their glamour and wealth rather than their accolades. Some people seem to think this is not good for the younger minds who are getting inspired by them. 

There are several aspects to this mindset. On one hand there are many platforms on  social media for becoming a star overnight. All of the success has rounded down to the views and likes these days. Grades and results seem to be things from the yesteryears. As  access to social applications is increasing, the number of people getting famous is also rising. Consequently, new generation is following them more as the days go by.

Subsequently, they are getting attracted to the easy way of becoming an icon and earning money.

First of all,the exposure to extravagant lifestyles can lead to the distortion of mindset and a pursuit of immediate financial success. Since the celebrities are able to earn a lot from endorsement. They purchase big houses and can afford luxuries bags and shoes. As a result, the youth, especially those earn meager wage and do not have enough disposable income, reckon the high profile figures as their fashion icons. They may purchase expensive brands to go with the flows and finally be left in financial difficulties.

Moreover some well known people, such as the influencers on social media, owning billion of fans just because of their flawless and doll-like appearances.

Similarly, as for businessman, thy have put in a lot of late nights and weekends to build their business even without certainty to success. Therefore, they deserve the fame and status, which can also stimulate the youth to work hard to reach their ambitions and owning the high quality lifestyle.

This essay completely agrees with the statement above because of toxic things like smoking and sometimes they could extend the wrong information affecting teenagers’ life.

 

First and foremost, well-known people could affect negatively the young generations through their lifestyles. It means that some humans could follow their favourite superstars to tattoo  their faces or use illicit drugs when they are inspired by their idols through social media. For example, many teenagers have a trend to use drugs like vape, cocaine, and alcohol when they see their famous singers and celebrities using them on live streams without thinking about the effects.

Furthermore, numerous celebrities can lead to misunderstanding among the youth generation. That is to say, some famous humans didn’t focus on their studies, but they were still successful, and it also means that their fans could unexpectedly raise awareness of the wrong information that they can also be wealthy without studying. For instance, Bill Gates mentioned this problem in his speech many years ago about how he felt regret when he expanded the wrong knowledge about studying in an unexpected way that he’s a billionaire, even dropping out of school.

While humans can protect themselves with the help of their scientific and  technological advances, other living species are largely vulnerable to famine, loss of natural habitat or even extinction. For example, due to global warming, many polar animals, namely polar bears are suffering a great loss and ultimately death as they largely depend on the polar cap to find food and shelter. Therefore, even if humans could find an alternative way to survive the catastrophe, there can be no chance for some of these vulnerable species. 

Moreover, even if the present generation could withhold the challenges of climate change, it will likely become harder and harder for  future generations. This is because, if the current situation should continue for several decades, it would become more difficult for  future generations to tolerate the aftermath. Therefore, it seems immoral and selfish to offer such hardships for the forthcoming. 

On the other hand, there are some arguments stating that people should learn to live with the challenging aspects of  global warming and other climate change instead of trying to prevent it. However, it should be well noted that temperature shifts and their consequences should be prevented and avoided at all costs.

In conclusion, the prevention of climate change and global warming crisis should be well addressed and attempted by our current generation as it can help not only  mankind, but many other living species and our future generations as well.",5,"There are some people who may think that  mankind should find a way to deal with this emerging issue rather than fight against it.: Fragment

However, some people believe, that we should not try to prevent climate change, but to find a way to live with it.

Climate change is not a myth, but it is something that is happening right now. The volatility of temperatures is the best example for that. In Bulgaria summer is becoming longer and hotter. Climate change has a very negative impact on environment - forests are being destroyed because of fires, animals are dying because of change in their habitat, glaciers are melting.

"Nowadays, some people are of the opinion that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. I am totally in support of this decision to find a way to maintain an equilibrium with our climatic conditions. This would afford us the opportunity to plan ahead of any Unknown circumstances caused by the atmospheric condition and ensure a clean, safer, and more conducive environment.

Firstly, the knowledge of the atmospheric conditions prevents the occurrence of perilous situations that can destroy the environment such as flood, tsunami, hurricanes etc. For instance, a better knowledge of the weather forecast will ensure we plan our movement in situations of unexpected heavy rainfall . I was able to stay indoor during the recent heavy downpour due to the earlier information obtained from the weather forecast site which prevented me from being caught in the Flood.

Furthermore, having adequate climatic knowledge makes the environment safer and more conducive to live for people. We are able to ensure a good drainage system is put in place by every occupants of a building through proper road planning. This saved my building from the recent flood that happened last week as majority of the houses in the south west area were been flooded as there were no proper layout for drainage.

First of all, to begin with, the main reason why this idea is not right is that we have opportunities to intervene and prevent further progression of this tendency. This is because of the fact that not only are there developments in technologies but also scientists and ecologists develop new ways of fighting. Therefore, if we have a chance to change the situation it seems extremely incorrect to ignore the problem.

Moreover, another evidence why people should try to prevent climate change is that it may get extremely worse so the Earth may become uninhabitable. The major reason for such a thought is that climate deteriorates in a geometric progression and without appropriate measures this issue may become inevitable. Hence, the whole process of global climate change may accelerate and we will not be able to slow down it in the future.

In my opinion it is completely wrong, due to its slaughtering effect on inhabitant's life even with minor changes .

First of all, the arguement of finding a way to live with climate change, could only be claimed by those, who could not understand the destructive impacts of small changes in globe's temperature .

Since the ice masses started to melt long while ago, this era seem to be so late for tiny resolutions. The bigger damaging factors, such as overuse of fossil fuels and waste methods other than recycling should have been adressed so long ago by the governments.

Considering the probable and close effects of the climate change, the only matter mankind may get used to is the new lifestyle, which is more friendly to the balance of atmosphere. This meaures can be exemplified by sun pannels and wind turbines for producing energy and developping sustainable recycling methods for wastes.

More powerful restrictions on humankind's dangerous actions, should be implemented on war footing, in order to saving our kind and other inhabitants of the whole world.

 On the first hand, crucial meaning that many people do achieve without really hard working for it.Lots people ,who do not do correct hard-working,can take significant achieve by their opportunity.They may be inherited by money from parents,married to eminent partner,or they may be on gossip journals on a really TV projects.For example,Antonela Roccuzzo who is a wife of legendary football player Lionel Messi.She is rich and wife of the most famous player in the world.Antonelo goes to Messi's matches and morally support him.They have being married since 2017.The wife of football player became famous by her husband,but she did not exertion be herself.The allusion for young people is that success can be achieved easily,and their projects and school works are not necessary for it

On the other hand,there are as least as many examples to role models by hard working,whose accomplishments can be glorious example for young people.Musician,athletes,actors and social media stars make considerable achieve only by their really diligence.They work for more than 5-6 hours per day for their target and in the future they will get resultat of these endeavor.For example,Will Smith.He is one of the most famous people in the world.He tried to be on main roles and worked for result in the future.Nowadays,I believe that he earns millions of dollars lying at home being a celebrated and achieved actor.If the youth watch connection between trying and success,they will want to start their programmes and projects for their goal.Because,in my opinion that this type of celebrated talents can pull youth to the good side

"Nowadays, it is true that lots of famous celebrities are known for their glamour and wealth lifestyle rather than for their talents and achievements. While I agree that these celebrities set a bad example for the young generation, I believe that other stars are well known by their significant achievements. 

On the one hand, it is undeniable fact that many famous people become popular by their fancy lifestyle without really working for it. They may have money from their parents or they may have appeared on a reality TV programme by showing their wealth and glamour lifestyle. A good example would be family of Kardashians who are famous for their reality show, which mostly shows their luxuries, party, shopaholic lifestyle. This type of behavior would be a negative influence on young people that success can be achieved easily without working and studying. 

On the other hand, there are many celebrities who are popular for their incredible acts and performance which makes them excellent role model for young people. These people have shown that they worked hard and applied themselves to develop their skills and abilities. They demonstrate to young generation a great effort and determination which are necessary to be truly successful in their field. One of the examples would be a great singer Dimash Kudaibergen, who has become famous for whole world because of his hard work and years of practice. This kind of celebrities can inspire youth to develop their talents through persistent and being diligent to their succeed.

Although the climate change started a few decades ago, there is still a chance to stop it by developing laws and signing global contracts for reducing the carbon footprint of every single country on earth.

"It is true that juvenile delinquency has been rampant, especially in metropolitan areas, in recent decades, leading to a whole host of other issues. Although some believe that violence in the media is what causes the increase in juvenile crime, some other causes should be taken into account as well.  
 There are a number of reasons why juvenile crime is growing. First, since most teenagers nowadays have access to the Internet, juvenile crime becomes more organized, well-planned and secure than it was in the past.  For example, most of the recruitment or crime planning work can be done seamlessly through a social network channel that vows to protect user’s privacy, making it a challenge for the police to prevent real crime in advance.  Second, some large cities, like Chicago, are rife with drug trafficking targeting young adults. Plenty of evidence suggests that human’s brains are susceptible to the negative influence of drugs, which often triggers the desire to commit juvenile crime.  
 Nevertheless, there are also a variety of solutions to alleviate this issue. First, Internet police can disguise themselves as normal young adults who wish to join those illegal groups for investigation and evidence gathering purposes. The police would have the opportunity to not only prevent the particular crime beforehand but also understand the underlying structure behind any contemporary juvenile delinquency. Second, law enforcement should take step to tighten drug control to ensure little to no drug supply in the market. For instance, increasing fines and penalties for drug-related activities would act as a deterrent for drug traffickers and buyers. 
 In conclusion, the Internet and the drug industry are two contributing factors to juvenile crime. Internet police and law enforcement should cooperate to minimize the issue to a manageable level.",5,"The police would have the opportunity to not only prevent the particular crime beforehand but also understand the underlying structure behind any contemporary juvenile delinquency.: Run-on

"Among most of us assume that we have to live with climate changes rather than avoiding it. In my opinion, we cannot hide from the unexpected changes by nature. 
As our world grows, new technologies emerge everyday, we heard about new innovations. It's great that we are evolving, but is it only we are evolving? No, environment is also evolving with us because of pollution, technologies and so on. It's hard for a person to leave his country because of weather, if the money he have is not sufficient enough to make him able to stay in some new region. It's hard for a person to leave his homeland, so many people does not seem like the idea of leaving everything behind. Like, in our country summer becomes unbearable and extremely hot. But from the population of 100% only 10% would be able to eliminate this, rest of them need to live with it.
Although it's hard to survive in an abrupt change of an atmosphere around us but thanks to technology we find the enormous amount of solutions to beat this. In hotter countries people often work at night and in colder countries people work at noon. They often use Air-conditioners and heaters according to their needs. People always find solutions to make their life more comfortable.
To conclude, it's not essential for one to turn over because of climate but to adapt, is the key to grow more.

"Every living organisms life are influenced by the weather system. Due to different types of pollutions, global warming and other factors the climate begins to change. A few peoples have the opinion that finding a living method according to the climate method is the better choice than that of controlling climatic changes.

Climate plays a significant role in the food products we consume daily to survive. Though we have a plethora of varaities of food across the world, every country will choose their own variety of food which suits their climatic condition. Frequent climate change will also impact the cultivation of crops. Mostly, farmers select the crops to be cultivated based on the seasons. For example, In India, the northern half remains to be cold and dry, so the farmers will cultivate wheat whereas, in southern half will have good rain and also it remains warm in few months of the year so the farmers in the south will choose rice. Even though we are in the technology developed world, there is no alternative found for food.

Not only humans but also other living organisms will also affect by this climatic change. Most of the animal breed based on the climate only as a consequence of climatic change the particular animal may move to the verge of extinction. Furthermore, It will also affect the trees and plants across the world. Factually, the average life span of trees are around 60 years and also they will grow based on the climate and soil types alone. If the climate started to change, there is a high probability of extinction of the trees. Trees are the major oxygen producer of the world, humans inhale oxygen to live. As a result, there is no possibility for the survival of the living organisms in the world.

In conclusion, by the above discussion, I strongly oppose the opinion of finding the method to live according to the climate change. If we chose there is less probability to get a high success rate. Because it requires the reconstruction of the whole world based on the climate changed which includes food, trees etc.",5,"If the climate started to change, there is a high probability of extinction of the trees.: Fragment

"Global warming threats our lives in many ways , and it is quite a challenge to deal with rising temperatures that could result from industrialization and deforestation. I totally disagree that we should adopt living with such circumstances . There are two primary reasons for this.

Firstly,ecological degradation should be shunned. This is because we ought to live in a friendly environment , inwhich governments would introduce grass root programme to protect forests and grow new trees as populations are arising in almost every country and this is causing trees to be constantly cut down to provide shelter and also food. Trees are critical due to the fact that they absorb CO2 , and rising levels of CO2 have been linked to higher temperature levels.

Secondly, I believe that climate change need to be avoided ,so we can live in a healthy well-being environment without the detrimental effects . For example, air pollution and lung cancer that could result from industrialization. Nowadays,there is a growth of industrial areas in developing countries. Many nations in Asia and Africa are building more and more factories everyday to meet the demands of their ever increasing populations and for export purposes. Again, government should put guidelines to cut harmful activities such as waste disposal and limit the usage of plastic bags in supermarkets.

"Some argue that the government should invest money on the conservation and renovations of historic buildings. Others believe that this money will be spent on new public constructions. 

I believe that investing public resources in the conservation of existing buildings can be the better option.  Some of my reasons will be explored in the remainder of this essay and a logical conclusion will be drawn at the end. 

Some constructions are part of the history and identity of people. Firstly, worldwide it is possible to find different buildings associated with relevant historical events. What is more,  many of these are used today as museums or cultural centers to illustrate, the Zocalo in Mexico City is a complex of historical buildings and it is nowadays still used as a cultural and political meeting center.  

Clearly, buildings associated with the roots of citizens should be conserved and for this proposed need of invest money from governments.    

 

Another important point in favor of the conservation of old constructions is the economy. 

To begin with, tourists travel worldwide in order to visit important buildings and museums

In addition, the tourism industry moves thousands of millions of dollars per year and for some regions this is the source of important income. For example,  hundreds of people travel every year to the Yucatan Peninsula in the south of Mexico to visit the ancient ruins and museums. So, investing money in conservation and renovation can be beneficial to the economy of countries and regions. 

In conclusion, I admit that spending public money on creating new public constructions can contribute to urban development, but, renovation and conservation of existing ones should be a priority.",5," Some constructions are part of the history and identity of people.

"It is true fact that funds should be spent on creating  new infrastructures such as museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones. I am in the favour of latter notion to a larger extent and I  will discuss the reasons in further paragraphs.

To commence with , in the cutting-edge era individuals have no payment to make new infrastructures. The most effective reason is the increasing population day by day . For instance ,

If the population level is increased so masses have no opportunity for making money and have had  an extra source of income. Hence , folks are not able to make new infrastructures when they choose the path of renovating houses. ,, Moreover another aspect is less education level among the masses . For paradigm , modern generation is well educated but all the individuals are not young generation among them some are senior citizens and not well educated . So they have no new idea about the making of new infrastructure .

On the other hand , making new infrastructure it is a good idea so far as individuals have created the new infrastructures Accordingly . For doing this they have a crunch of money and they made new Houses.

For instance , if individuals do this so masses get many new opportunities to do work and  made some money . Thus , it is very helpful for the masses who's has no extra source of money making.

To sum up , in the present climate individuals want to make new buildings rather than renovate the houses.

"The question of spending money on the construction or renovting public buildings depends upon various factors. These factors consists of the budget, availability of land incase of the construction of new building and lastly the neccessity. Considering all these factors I think that renovating existing public buildings is a better way to spend money rather than creating a new one. I believe that the foresaid idea has more advantage than its counterpart.

When it comes to renovating existing buildings it does not points out the frugality of the authorities but it is the efficient way of spending money by authorities. It is no doubt the simple renovation cost less than half than constructing a new building. Moreover tourists are most likely to visit old buildings with heritage has always been a great  source of income to the torism sector. The Notre dame of Paris is a great example of such buildings since it is equally visited b the the same number of people who visit the Eiffel tower.

The availability of land for the construction of new buildings is a good question that follows. Such buildings must be built at the heart of the region but there might not be any space available in city centre. Since it requires large area of land and acquiring it may require a hefty amount of money. Neccessity of building it plays a major role because simply constructing a new public building must have a compelling reason backong it. Only regions requiring tourist attractions and newly developed cities may need new ublic buildings. If old public buildings are taken into account there were reasons for building it. For example the Louvre museum in Paris was constructed to showcase the great artworks done by the artists belonging to their country.

To sum up the idea of spending money towards renovating existing public buildings overshadows the construction of new ones. It is due to the fact that the advantages of renovation overweighs the concept of new consruction, these advantages mainly falls in the vies of finance, land availability and neccesity. So I strongly place my views on the aspect of renovating old public buildings rather than constructing a new one.",5,"The question of spending money on the construction or renovating public buildings depends upon various factors.

"Nowadays, the government's investment has never failed to provoke debates among people. Some suppose that spending money on developing technology for space discovery is worthless, others make a statement that there are more tremendous tactics to utilize that amount of money. This essay is dedicated to analysing a personal perspective. 

Without a shadow of doubt, exploring the universe acts as a precursor to our life since it helps humans to find a new habitable planet. Nowadays, overpopulation has become a dire issue which exerts the lack of living space as well as the overexploitation of natural sources due to higher hierarchies. On top of that, with the groundbreaking development of the economy, there is an ever-increasing number of factories and private transportation. These two elements serve as a main drive to a thriving carbon footprint and then lead to air pollution and respiratory disease. While the Earth is suffering from recession, it is necessary to discover a new place as a backup plan in the future. 

Despite the redeeming features of space exploring, other fields should not be neglected. In specific, education also needs investing as it plays a paramount significant role for long-term development. Once getting access to school in order to absorb knowledge as well as hone set of skills, students will become aspiring for a quality workforce, which facilitates the company’s productivity. Furthermore, it will enhance a country’s economy. However, there are still existing problems like many impoverished teenagers can not get tertiary education, a tight budget may hinder the students from having practical experiments. With a view to addressing these issues, there is a myriad of ways that can be cited such as reducing the tuition fees, applying top-notch technology or giving scholarships.

*To begin, Payment of taxes generates revenues for the government.¹ The government ought to be responsible to her citizens in many ways and most of the roles that the government plays require money and  if the people do not pay tax, then the government will be bankrupt and unable to carry out her responsibilities.³ For example, countries like United Kingdom has been noted to fund 80% her annual budget from taxation of citizens whose needs the state strives to meet.³ Payment of levies is therefore paramount⁴* .

*In addition,these payment  to the state makes the people more responsible¹. Tax payers have a sense of responsibilities unconsciously inculcated into them and usually view state's amenities and interest as theirs and often thrive to protect same. ² For instance, a study carried out in Spain revealed that people who paid taxes were more keen at protecting state owned amenities than those who did not.³ The need to keep contributing part of one's earning to the state cannot be overemphasized .⁴*

*Nevertheless , the government or handlers of these funds might  embezzle or misappropriate them. However with regular demand from responsible citizens for accountability and strong institutions to punish offenders, this can be reduced to the barest minimum.*

"Some advocate the view that the government should not promulgate income tax for its citizens. To the best of my knowledge, I totally disagree with this statement inasmuch as the funding from taxation can be used to contribute to the benefit of individuals and the society as a whole.

"Taxes are essential for the growth of the country. A group of individuals believe that they should keep all their earnings and should not have any obligation in paying the taxes to the government. I personally disagree with this notion and firmly believe that citizens are entitled to pay the taxes for the betterment of the country and for an enhanced way of living.

To begin with, taxes are used by the government for developing their nations. Taxes are allocated to various kinds of essential matters. Firstly, they are used to develop infrastructure facilities like roads and highways, improving or replacing existing transportation units. Secondly, taxes are utilised for providing residents with decent medical services and education facilities. For example, in countries like Canada and Australia, the citizens enjoy free medical and education facilities as they contribute to the government in form of taxes. Last but not least, the government spends huge amount collected through taxes on military services and facilities for maintaining the political stability and harmony of the country.

And then, people should also look that taxes they have paid, will also be beneficial for themselves sooner or later.Some of the funds collected by the government are used for retirement funds. For instance, people above 60 years of age who find difficult to secure a job with minimum wages can rely  on these funds. Therefore, people should not keep all their earnings to themselves and must comply on paying the taxes to the government.

To conclude, I do not agree that people should have a hold of all the money they earn as taxes are the primary source for the government for building the nation and ensuring that its citizen leads an enhanced lifestyle.",5,"And then, people should also look that taxes they have paid, will also be beneficial for themselves sooner or later.Some of the funds collected by the government are used for retirement funds.: Run-on

"In the present scenario, people are putting a lot of efforts to earn and save money. Therefore, a section of the society believes in keeping the earned income to themselves by not paying any taxes to the nation. Even though they have genuine reasons behind, I completely disagree with the above mentioned notion.

Every person prepares the budget wherein their motive is to save maximum money. There are innumerable reasons  behind it; to meet their over exceeding expenditures; to employ the income into a more lucrative idea or maybe the dissatisfaction of the government.  For example, in a family of four members wherein only one person is earning he has to work really hard to manage the needs of the family and pay out the taxes. In such a situation they always look for additional income by skipping the tax fee and investing somewhere else. In total, people believe the non payment of duty will resolve their financial issues

However, on the contrary, one has to always look at the broader spectrum. The tax amount received by the state is being used for the welfare of the citizens only. The development of the parks and historic buildings, reserves to meet contingencies  and many more are being taken care of by them. In some countries, namely Canada, contribution amount act as a health insurance to the people and also provide free education in the schools. Moreover, it is the moral responsibility of every citizen. Overall, in the long run regular tariff fee will prove fruitful for us only.

"It is undeniable that most companies rely on interviews for hiring new employees, but some people believe that this dependence on interviews is wrong and that other alternatives should be preferred as they are better. I believe that interviews are a reliable method, and the other methods cannot be considered more effective.

There are many reasons why interviews are suitable for hiring new employees. Firstly, through the interview, the recruiters can get an idea about the personality and social skills of the potential employees. In interviews, there is face-to-face interaction, and the candidates have to answer impromptu questions, from which personality traits can be judged. Also, by asking some case study-type questions, employees can judge traits like the ability to handle pressure, confidence and the ability to think outside the box.

In addition, although there are many other methods for hiring, none of them could be considered superior to interviews. One the other common method is the written test, which is good to judge the theoretical knowledge of the person. However, this method cannot give a good idea about the personality of the candidate. By contrast, through interviews, employers can judge both the knowledge and temperament of the potential employee. Moreover, the written test is fallible to cheating as sometimes candidates can take outside help.

Another selection process is a group discussion, which is good where a major job requirement is conversational and persuasion skills for instance sales jobs. They are really not suited for technical jobs because these are not customer oriented. On the other hand, interviews hold good for any type of job as the interviewer can frame questions to test the particular skills they require.

To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the preference for interviews for hiring among employers is justified as interviews have advantages over other commonly adopted methods.",6.5,"""One the other common method is the written test, which is good to judge the theoretical knowledge of the person.""

"Interviews are commonly used as a way to screen candidates at large companies. However, some people argue that interviews are not an effective way to recruit employees. I agree that relying on interviews alone can lead to hiring the wrong professional. However, I believe that when used in combination with other assessment methods, such as group activities and quizzes, interviews can be a valuable tool in the hiring process.

 

Organisations are increasingly using group activities to assess applicants’ suitability for their roles. This allows them to see how potential employees react under pressure and how they handle conflict. These simulations give organisations a better understanding of the professional’s values, behaviours and thinking patterns. As candidates often lie in the interview and tend to act like robots answering the questions the way the recruiter expects, the information gathered in the group work can then be used alongside interview results to make final hiring decisions.

 

Secondly, personality quizzes can be a useful tool for assessing job seekers' profiles and determining their strengths and weaknesses. Such tests can help to identify which aspirants are naturally good mediators and which ones will require more direction from others. If one of the criteria for the role is to hire someone with strong leadership skills, then mediators may be the best option. 

 

In conclusion,  it's important to remember that no single method is perfect and that interviews are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to recruiting.

"As the economy is advancing by leaps and bounds, the attitude people adopt towards recruitment has undergone a noticeable and far-reaching transformation. Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether there are other effective alternatives to interviews which have been fundamental choosing standards. For my part, I side with the advocates to a larger extent based on the following sound reasons.

Firstly, it is noteworthy that conversations fail to make a comprehensive assessment of job-seekers. Nowadays, many studies have shown that although it is invisible, the meeting in person can not make the evaluation of the honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness of applicants because of limited interaction in a short period of time. Therefore, it will be a grave mistake to overlook the fact that interviews are not the most dependable method for recruitment. For example, in some countries where employers give high weight to whole-life employment, reference from current employees is widely applied to recruit new staff rather than public advertisement and interviews. This example is the illustration of the fact that talking is not a totally reliable method for some inherited shortcomings.

Secondly, the counter-argument raised by objectors is that without meeting job-seekers can not show off their abilities, and experiences. This belief could be attributed to the fact that in large measure, conversations have been widely used to check the richness of capabilities such as interpersonal interaction skills, resilience and critical thinking skill via giving questions and requiring immediate answers. This argument is true to some degree; however, it is incomplete, what they fail to take into account is that meetings can not go further to check criminal records or bank credit. For instance, according to some research, when it comes to fulfilling vacancies for managers, directors, and chief officers; most companies are inclined to use services provided by head-hunting companies because these companies are specialized in seeking highly qualified workers with special tools, professional means.

In conclusion, I am convinced that there are more productive methods to recruit new personnel than interviews for the reasons mentioned above. From this point, people need to prepare a good quality thoroughly to achieve their career target and successfully pass all the company's criteria.",6.5,"""Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether there are other effective alternatives to interviews which have been fundamental choosing standards."": fragment ""This argument is true to some degree; however, it is incomplete, what they fail to take into account is that meetings can not go further to check criminal records or bank credit."": run-on",,
"Different eminent companies think interview is a satisfaction method for basic selection. However, there are those who say that interview is not a perfect system of choosing employees as well as there are other better methods. I completely believe that interview process is the best way in this essay. I will examine my point of view. 

Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why I believe that phenomenon. Perhaps the main reason is that communication skill, confidence and group working mentality can be understood by taking interview. Moreover, some people do not feel comfortable when they communicate with others. For example, in sales and marketing job workers should have good communication skills to persuade customers by giving advertise about their product. Furthermore, in multinational job, people have to do work in a group.there may have foreign people. so in that case, communication is the most crucial skill. 

Another reason why I believe with this statement is that fundamental skill. there are some company where workers need basic skill and good knowledge about their sector. In addition, the owner can check their portfolio and ask basic questions by face to face interview. For instance, in it related job, the workers need basic cognition in programming. If they have this learning, , they have to have a good portfolio and LinkedIn ID .So the holder of the company can check it. 

to sum up, communication skill, confidence and group working mentality and basically skill will be verified by interview. This is difficult by other methods in sales and  marketing sector job as well as it sector job. So is it is authentic scheme.",6.5,"""Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why I believe that phenomenon."" (The phrase ""Generally speaking"" is a sentence fragment.)

"Many multinational companies conduct interviews in order to select the best candidates for their organisation. Although it may be argued that interviews are not a reliable method of selecting a person for a job, I agree with the premise and will substantiate my reasons in the course of this essay.

     The expression ""First impression, is the best impression"" comes to mind here because this is what interviews are basically about. A company gets many applications for any given job requirement. Therefore in order to ""thin out the herd"", firms hold these formal discussions so as to gauge the interviewees. Moreover, this way the interviewer will also be able to assess the technical know-how of the applicant and his expectations. In addition, the temperament of the applicant can be assessed along with his communication level. The communication level is a very important aspect of a job because there may be situations where a potential employee needs to speak to senior-level managers, and if they are unable to convey their message in a simplistic manner, then the message gets lost.

         Furthermore, it is an opportunity for the company to provide a potential employee with their expectations of them, and also through these discussions help them to determine whether the applicant will suit their working environment. Also, through a face to face interview, interviewers can get to know through the body language and facial expressions the exact intent of the applicant. This is very important and cannot be obtained from a resume.

         To conclude, I believe that interviews are important from a company's perspective for obtaining the best employee for their requirement. As they are going to be paying for their services in terms of salaries, it is only fair that they get to see the potential employee and understand their capabilities.",6.5,"

"In the modern world, traditionally, in order to get a job in a good place, people need to go through a series of interviews. This practice is quite universal and many companies use it. Despite everything, this method has a number of disadvantages and advantages. In spite of the advantages, I think a meeting is a good path.

Advocates of the method believe that today at the time, when a huge number of people are fighting for equality and diversity, a universal approach  to recruiting can be the key to a successful business. Another good thing about interviews is HR specialists should not prepare to examine every candidate  separately. It makes the process  of recruiting more simple and faster.  And finally, the third reason why conferences are a fine practice for future employees can make ready and answer some common questions before face-to-face communication and it helps them to be more confident and relaxed during the interview.

There are, however, some disadvantages. Common approaches for recruiting may not take into account the personal qualities of a job applicant. A talented but timid  person may suffer from such an interview where he or she will feel uncomfortable. Another bad thing in the interview is monotony. A lot of men and women say the same things day after day. Either because it is taught in the courses, or because humans  think that it will be better if they say common phrases, however, it often happens that a person goes through a dozen interviews in different companies, but does not find a job.

In my opinion, there are maybe better ways of tackling this problem. For instance, HR specialists can approach recruiting in a more personalized way. Every person is unique and if the company wants to be cool,  modern and successful, then this company should take into account the capabilities of each person working in it. In the end, happy people work much better.",6.5,"

Even though some people think that there are better methods for employing a resource rather than interviews , I wholeheartedly believe that interview is a good method for recruiting candidates. First I will discuss some arguments supporting my ideas about this statement, after which some aspects against that will be presented.

 On the one hand, many people agree with this statement for many noteworthy reasons. The most remarkable is that the recruiters can get an idea about the personalitty and skills of the potential employees .For instance,when the person is asked about any topic and he answers it in a concise and crisp manner,then the recruiter gets to know he is suitable for the job. Another key reason is that if a candidate is asked about case studies then the recruiters can judge the personality traits of that employee and also the ability to think outside the box.

They believe that other modes of recruiting like written tests and group discussions will help understand the mindset in a better manner.Written tests help in evaluating the technical or theoretical knowlege of a person.

Group discussions help in getting a grasp of the conversational skills that he/she possesses.For example,in sales and marketing jobs conversational skills play a major role.

"Many multinational and national companies select their staff after a lot of research. In that face to face interaction is the prime site for an employee hiring. Although, it is considered by few that interview is not an appropriate way of filling the vacancy and there are more reliable sources. However, I mostly disagree with the view. My point  is justified further.

If it was easy to crack an interview of reputed establishments, then everyone might had got a place in each corporation. Moreover, it is not a piece of cake for all, it needs courage, dedication along with proper knowledge because all true colours flow out in front of interviewers. One of the many criteria judged is, crammed theory. For example, when a person is given a complicated situation and asked how will they put their learning into an action. Such is the time when the stars start surrounding around the head, because all they remember is what the theory says, but do not know the real life application of that intelligence. Thus, the individual gets rejected as they do not need a book, but a human engine to run their machines. Furthermore, other criteria to qualify is, communication skills. For example, if a product is needed to be sold, then the buyers should be provided with as best offer as possible, just for company profit. Whatever, the business it is running, the best way to buy or sell products is negotiation with the way of talking and persuading them with some schemes. In addition, introsceptiner also notes the practical exposure and change of facial express. For example, expressions like lies, fear, worry, anxiety and the capability of a man.

 The capability of a person is also judged by his past interest and achievements until now.

On the contrary, the era has changed and continuation of age old methods of employee acceptance needs a change. This can be bought by replacing the system with either  questionnaire pamphlet or multiple short tests. For example, all the interviewing  questions, exam can be taken or else multiple different field exam. By this the need for interview will also not arise and the manager can fully check the person, along with saving their time.

To conclude, the new system can be introduced, but interviews cannot be replaced by those methods, as it is the most reliable source for knowing a person thoroughly.",6.5,"“In that face to face interaction is the prime site for an employee hiring.” (This is a sentence fragment.

"Recruiting new employees can be a long and painful process. But it is important for the all organizations and In IT companies. Because the success of any organization depends on the quality of its staff. So, most of the employers conduct a interviews for hiring a new staff. I disagree with the given statement which says that interview is not a reliable method and other methods are better. A number of arguments  surround my opinion.
To begin with, there are many reasons why interview is an important method for the recruiter. First and foremost, interview is the only method in which employers can get an idea about the personality and social skill of the potential candidates. In interview, there is face to face interaction and candidate have to answer the impromptu questions, which leaves vey little scope for hiding personality traits. Also employees can judge traits like ability to handle pressure, confidence and ability to think outside the box and so on by asking the some study type questions. 
On the other hand, there are many other selection methods with varied advantages. One of the other common method is prefferd when the focus is on jugging theoretical knowledge of the person. For example, in some IT companies theoretical knowledge is very important because employees have to send a email for their clients. Last but not least, there can be combination of the all the three methods like written tests, followed by group discussion and finally interview. 
To conclude, I cannot agree that interview is not reliable method and other methods are better. It depends upon the job and company requirement, in some situations conducting interviews is more opt and in some situations the other methods may be more advantageous.",6.5,"“But it is important for the all organizations and In IT companies.” (This is a sentence fragment.

"The increase in the production of consumer goods has detrimental effects on the natural environment, primarily due to several interconnected causes. One major factor is the overconsumption and demand for disposable products, leading to excessive resource extraction, pollution, and waste generation. Fast fashion, electronic gadgets, and single-use plastics contribute significantly to environmental degradation.

Additionally, the use of non-renewable resources in manufacturing processes, such as fossil fuels and raw materials, intensifies the environmental impact. Extracting these resources often involves destructive practices, further compromising ecosystems.

To address this issue, a multifaceted approach is essential. Firstly, there should be a shift towards sustainable production and consumption practices. Companies can adopt eco-friendly manufacturing processes, utilize recycled materials, and design products with longevity in mind. Governments can implement and enforce regulations that promote environmental responsibility in manufacturing.

Consumer awareness and education play a crucial role. Encouraging individuals to make informed and sustainable choices, such as supporting eco-friendly brands and opting for durable goods, can significantly reduce the demand for environmentally harmful products.

Innovations in technology also offer solutions. For instance, the development of biodegradable materials, advancements in recycling technologies, and the promotion of a circular economy can help mitigate the negative impact of consumer goods production.

An example of a positive shift is the growing popularity of sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical sourcing, eco-friendly materials, and transparency in their production processes. Such initiatives demonstrate that it is possible to align consumerism with environmental consciousness.

In conclusion, addressing the environmental damage caused by the production of consumer goods requires a comprehensive approach involving sustainable practices in manufacturing, government regulations, consumer awareness, and technological innovations. By collectively working towards these solutions, we can mitigate the ecological footprint associated with the increasing demand for consumer goods.",6.5,,,
"With the development of technology and techniques, more and more different goods are introduced for consumers. While the phenomenon gives rise to a variety of pollution, there are also some methods that we can use to solve problems.

In order to face the increasing number of productions, thousands of factories are established to enhance production and promote revenue. Most of those take advantage of fossil fuels to generate power for the use of production. Nevertheless, it would contribute to an amount of toxic air pollution and discharge sewage. More specifically, the factories not only pose a threat to people’s physical health but also contaminate the quality of air. Therefore, despite the fact that more factories can improve production efficiency, it influences our environment and deteriorates air quality.

While a variety of problems are caused by production, there are some solutions that can alleviate the condition. On the part of the government, they can enact some legal regulations for the purpose of managing the performance of factories’ production processes. In other words, strict rules can pose a standard for merchants to follow up, and choose renewable material in the production process. As far as the customers are concerned, they can spontaneously choose goods that are produced by eco-friendly materials and boycott the commodities that are produced by hazardous materials. Accordingly, if there is more consumption of those goods, merchants will gradually increase the amount of environmental raw materials.

In conclusion, although the production process of goods may give rise to air pollution and deteriorate the environment, the government and customers can take some actions to alleviate the situation.",6.5,"“Nevertheless, it would contribute to an amount of toxic air pollution and discharge sewage.”: fragment “Most of those take advantage of fossil fuels to generate power for the use of production.

"As the world developed over the years, naturally the variety and quantity of products only increased, and alongside that the amount of consumption among the human species only increased. Many argue that this is resulting in an ecosystem that is becoming increasingly damaged. Firstly, I will develop more on the main causes of this problem than I will discuss further a way to tackle this issue by proposing one of several other necessary solutions to this problematic situation.

One of the problems is that, in the last one hundred years the world has developed a lot and nowadays with all the advancements in technology it has become cheaper and quicker to produce all types of  goods; such as clothes, plastic materials, and everyday gadgets. Secondly, most people, especially those living in first-world countries can afford to buy almost anything they need to have a comfortable life. Although this  sounds like something positive for human livelihood, unfortunately in the long term the consequences of excessive production and waste can be catastrophic for the global environment. Furthermore, because of the excessive pollution, we are suffering climate change at a more rapid rate and seeing more severe natural disasters as a consequence.

A possible solution for this issue would be to make the younger generations more conscious of the consequences of human consumerism and its impact on the planet. For example, students could be thought how to take care of  nature in their first grades of schooling. Another beneficial option would be to take students of all ages to pick up waste in parks and beaches around their community, therefore educating not only them but all their families. As a result, we would have better-educated generations that in the future will be able to take care of the health of the world and possibly reduce or even control the heating of the globe.

In summary, this critical state that  nature is facing today is mainly a consequence of the excessive production of things that end up in landfills. Generally, the fast-paced development of the world production of goods, better affordability and unawares ness is the reason for this issue to be occurring. Thus, what might be an effective solution to prevent further damage to the environment would be to focus on educating young kids so they can pass it on to future generations.",6.5,"“Firstly, I will develop more on the main causes of this problem than I will discuss further a way to tackle this issue by proposing one of several other necessary solutions to this problematic situation.”: fragment“As the world developed over the years, naturally the variety and quantity of products only increased, and alongside that the amount of consumption among the human species only increased.”: run-on",,
"In this day and age, as the more consumer goods are manufactured, the more damage has been inflicted on the environment. This essay will discuss some of the main reasons that cause this problem such as discharging the factory wastes to the environment and increasing the usage of single-use materials which are harmful to  nature. As for some solutions to this problem, imposing strict laws related to discharging wastes and promoting the use of echo-friendlier materials can be mentioned.

Factories use raw materials to manufacture any type of goods that are needed for the people. Producing always has some wastes and as production is increased, there will be more swages and toxic wastes released in nature. These chemical by-products from manufacturing can harm both marine and terrestrial animals and also can be harmful to any kind of plant and tree. The increase in demand and usage of single-use goods  is another reason for this problem. These days, most  people struggle with hectic life routines which lead them to prefer using single-use material as a time-saving choice in different situations. For instance, if someone wants to throw a party, he or she will choose to use disposable tableware rather than cutlery. Despite the short lifespan of these products, they will remain as wastes in nature for hundreds of years which may lead earth to a huge landfill and put all species in danger.

That said, certain measures could be taken to decrease the harm to the environment while the manufacturing of goods is increasing. First, governments should impose strict laws for factories related to the ways in which wastes are discharged. For instance, if the wastes of a factory are more than a defined and acceptable one, they should be punished and be forced to pay for the loss. Second, manufacturers should make eco-friendlier goods and also encourage people to use these types of products. As a good step toward this solution, Starbucks has made reusable paper and bamboo mugs that are used instead of plastic ones. 

All things considered, recently, there are some works done by humans which cause harm to the nature, such as increasing the amount of consumer goods production. This essay discussed two main reasons for this problem, which included how wastes were abandoned in nature and the increase in the usage of single-use materials. Also, as for solutions to this problem, having laws for how to dispose the factory sewage and encouraging society to use the organic materials were suggested.",6.5,"“Producing always has some wastes and as production is increased, there will be more swages and toxic wastes released in nature.”: fragment“In this day and age, as the more consumer goods are manufactured, the more damage has been inflicted on the environment.”:run-ọn",,
"t is maintained by some that students execute better when in a single-gender school, compared to a co-educational environment. However, in my opinion enrolling children in a mixed school is of utmost importance as it prepares them for the real world.

To begin with, co-educational institutes allow pupils to develop their team working and interpersonal skills. Teamwork provides ample opportunities for the students to interact and work together, which is completely lacking in single-sex schools. This can have a positive impact as at the present competitive market, employers are keener to hire individuals who can incorporate team spirit and social skills. In other words, when both the genders are able to communicate effectively and comfortably to achieve a task together, they have better career prospects in the future.

Another point to consider is that children are able to acquire a deeper understanding of the opposite gender and their views. As boys and girls have a different outlook on life, they can learn and benefit from each other in a coeducational setting. For instance, students assigned to work on a group project, can see aspects from a different angle and perspective, which results in a more positive outcome.

Finally, being taught together encourages competition between genders, which can often give rise to better results. In a competitive learning environment, students are more driven to succeed and surpass one another to achieve the desires outcomes. The majority of boys in co-educational schools perform better academically compared to the ones in same-sex schools, due to the fear of bad grades and feeling inferior in front of their female counterparts.

In conclusion, I believe mixed schools are better for the youngsters in the long run, particularly career-wise as it mirrors the real world much more closely than single gender schools.",6.5,"“t is maintained by some that students execute better when in a single-gender school, compared to a co-educational environment.”: fragment “This can have a positive impact as at the present competitive market, employers are keener to hire individuals who can incorporate team spirit and social skills.”: run-on",,
"Education is the key to becoming successful in life, however, most of the students find it difficult to concentrate on studying at school. Although they feel distracted, there are a lot of courses that students need to cover, and I will discuss possible solutions for improving their concentration in the upcoming paragraphs. 

Firstly, the main reason that the students are unable to attention to study is that they feel fear because of the extra syllabus as they feel they are unable to finish on time. For instance, most learners prefer to complete topics which are easy as otherwise they feel a stress on mind to finish it. Secondly, children love to spend time on the internet where they play video games up to late at night which is the main distraction as they are unable to get proper sleep due to which they have lack of energy to focus on their studies. 

The prominent solution for improving the curiosity of students towards their studies is that they make proper time for sleep which helps for the proper functioning of the brain. Elders have to make strict rules regarding the playing time of the kids so they get enough time to complete the homework as well as get time to revise class work.  

To conclude, children want to play video games most of the time which is the main cause that they do not like studying, whereas, their parents should make strict rules to limit their play time so they can focus better on education.",6.5,"“Firstly, the main reason that the students are unable to attention to study is that they feel fear because of the extra syllabus as they feel they are unable to finish on time.”: fragment “Education is the key to becoming successful in life, however, most of the students find it difficult to concentrate on studying at school.”:run-on",,
"It is true that many children find it difficult to focus on the course at school. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon, so we need to take a comprehensive approach to mitigate it.

On the one hand, several factors contribute to this aissue. One of the reasons is the development of technology such as the applications of smartphones. With smartphones, many students are addicted to the virtual world brought about by mobile games and gain a sense of achievement

, which cannot be found in schools. The influence of the environment is another main reason. For example, if the juveniles around them behave badly in schools like talking to others or sleeping in classes without being punished by teachers, which may have a bad impact on them and they may imitate this behaviour, leading to their lack of focus on their school work.

However, many measures can be taken to solve this problem. To begin with, parents can take children to do some outdoor activities such as kite flying and hiking. They are good ways for juveniles to get close to nature and be away from the virtual world. Then the children may understand the beauty of the real world. Furthermore, improving teaching quality is also important, which means teachers can make their teaching content more abundant to increase the opportunity for interaction with students. For instance, teachers should introduce more entertaining activities in classes such as brainstorming and group discussions. By doing so, the minors can focus more on the course at schools.

In conclusion, the development of technology and the influence of the environment are the main reasons why it is difficult for students to catch the course at school, but actions should be taken along several aspects through doing outdoor activities and heightening teaching quality.",6.5,"“With smartphones, many students are addicted to the virtual world brought about by mobile games and gain a sense of achievement, which cannot be found in schools.”: fragment“For example, if the juveniles around them behave badly in schools like talking to others or sleeping in classes without being punished by teachers, which may have a bad impact on them and they may imitate this behaviour, leading to their lack of focus on their school work.”: run-on",,
"No doubt, education needs proper attention and focus however these days a number of school-going students are unable to pay full concentration to their studies due to a lack of interest and feeling bored. In this ,  essay I will briefly explain the reason behind this trend and some possible solutions to overcome  this problem in the upcoming paragraphs.

Commence with the major cause behind this issue is they spend a maximum of hours on their cellphone at night while playing games as a result they feel lazy and sleep during school time  .Needless to say, due to parents' careless attitude towards their offspring lead this problem is rising rapidly nowadays. Secondly, the way of teaching also plays a very significant part in academics if the teacher just explains the textbook part without an example then children definitely feel inactive during study time .Apart from this , an unhealthy diet is the third main reason behind this problem .This is because nowadays teenagers love to eat junk food rather than healthy meals.Thus they face many problems while doing studies like eye pain , head pain and many other disorders. 

Although  these are the main problems which can be tackled by the parents and teacher support. First and foremost , parents have to fix their hours  to use smartphones , so that children can sleep early and complete their naps properly. Hence , they do not feel lazy and sleep in school . In fact , the school management has to Change their teaching ways  in which they involve practical work and add different examples to make children interested, thus students enjoy the way of learning and easily grab a topic knowledge. Additionally, parents should make food at home instead of ordering from outside so that students eat healthy food and stay fit and fine .Therefore , these things help to make the force on the education.

"In evaluating whether a surge in economic wealth in affluent countries directly correlates with heightened citizen satisfaction, I tend to disagree with the notion that additional economic prosperity fails to enhance the contentment of the populace.

While it's argued that increased economic wealth in already affluent nations doesn't significantly impact citizen satisfaction, I contend that such growth does play a pivotal role in improving the overall well-being and happiness of individuals. Firstly, heightened economic prosperity often leads to an augmented quality of life for citizens. It provides better access to essential services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, which are integral to improving the living standards of the population.

Moreover, economic growth in affluent countries can facilitate greater employment opportunities and higher incomes for individuals. A thriving economy fosters innovation and job creation, subsequently improving citizens' financial security and providing them with a sense of stability and satisfaction.

Additionally, economic growth enables societies to invest in technological advancements and infrastructure, resulting in increased convenience and efficiency in daily life. Advancements in technology often lead to improvements in various aspects of life, from communication to transportation, contributing to citizens' convenience and overall satisfaction.

Furthermore, a prosperous economy empowers governments to address societal challenges and invest in social welfare programs. These initiatives assist marginalized communities, reduce inequality, and promote social cohesion, crucial elements that contribute to citizens' contentment and happiness.

In conclusion, while some argue that increased economic wealth in affluent nations doesn't necessarily elevate citizen satisfaction, I firmly believe that economic growth significantly contributes to improving living standards, providing opportunities, fostering innovation, and addressing social issues. Hence, continued economic progress remains instrumental in enhancing the overall satisfaction and well-being of citizens in wealthy countries.",6.5,"“In evaluating whether a surge in economic wealth in affluent countries directly correlates with heightened citizen satisfaction, I tend to disagree with the notion that additional economic prosperity fails to enhance the contentment of the populace.”: fragment“Firstly, heightened economic prosperity often leads to an augmented quality of life for citizens.

"In contemporary society, some people think that wealth is the main factor which makes it possible for individuals' well-being, but others argue this idea. Therefore, although some nations are already rich and bring about the addition of economic wealth which increases, citizens in the countries do not feel more satisfied. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversy, and my opinion will be provided.

On the one hand, advocates of this perspective believe that even if arises  stable finance in nations that are already rich, it does not help the population in this country be more pleased. It is clear that economics is not a major determiner that allows people to pleasure in living. In other words, some regions may lack a variety of conveniences such as amusements, transport, and other facilities.

On the other hand, those against the idea of people in the rich countries feel that are not satisfied, despite  additional increases in finance. The reason is that the more there is budget in the countries, the more there is comfortable living because the budget is a foundation of development. Furthermore, the government will spend this fund on the generation of places which satisfy individuals, and they can provide a lot of supplies such as food and materials. As a result, the high-income regions can bring about benefits for citizens.

In conclusion, some researchers believe that  wealthy nations do not cause the population to feel more comfortable.

"Some professionals think that the residents will not satisfied with any additional growth in the economy since this nation is already wealthy. In my opinion, I firmly disagree with this statement because while there is a limit that money can bring to us, the increase in economic wealth still makes the citizens more delightful.

First of all, one of the reasons why I think the enhancement of Economic wealth still makes people happy is because there will more problems to tackle. As a result of the countries being rich, there will more issues will exist especially about the social. For instance, nowadays, the authorities and the residents need to face traffic congestion and pollution as a consequence of people will tend to buy more and more cars than ever, if the nation is rich, they can supply and encourage their populations to commute by vehicles which use environmentally friendly energy. Moreover, if the country is wealthy, it can provide the latest technology in many categories such as healthcare and education which makes people’s satisfaction grow. 

In contrast, sometimes economic growth will not make people more cheerful cause of the rise of the nation’s economy just a part of their life besides their well-being and relationships. For example, while a person is vibrant, they are a patient who is facing an illness that can not be treated so they will not have true satisfaction. In addition, we used to have money to meet our necessary needs such as food and a place to live, so when all our needs are supplied we will not care about money anymore.

In conclusion, I can't entirely agree with the statement that the citizens will not satisfied with the economic growth due to the fact that they have used to it because there will be more problems in a developed country than usual so we need money to solve it and also the government can supply the best things for their residents’s essential needs in life.",6.5,"“As a result of the countries being rich, there will more issues will exist especially about the social.” (This sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main subject or verb.)

"The world today is experiencing uncertainties and unrest owing to multiple challenges posed by the confrontation between nations, rivalries among the superpowers, and recently climate change. However, it is argued that the public of certain nations cannot be convinced anymore with further addition of resources, since they already own plenty. This essay, instead, disagrees with such an idea as it is quite impossible to consider yourself accomplished.

To start with, although there are scores of nations that are considered as huge economies whether due to their abundant natural resources or growth.

Nevertheless, there exists not even a single country that is independent in terms of goods required to run the cycle of life and does not require any external assistance.  For instance, even the world power USA with enormous power and dominance is not safe and its economy is lingering and is on the verge of collapse as per some experts.

In addition, time and technology bring changes, and dependency on any single factor for survival is a disaster and an unwise decision. 

 As earlier said, any disturbance in the geopolitical lens tends to affect the whole world, the supply chain of commodity items, dollar rate, and raw material for industries each and everything is affected and those counties that are enriched are too prone to these vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is considered quite pivotal to have a continuous addition of resources in any form in order to cope with the challenges, which are increasingly becoming complex. Furthermore, such wealth can be utilized to help less developed countries as well. 

In a nutshell, nations develop themselves to build a strong reputation and lessen their dependency on the rest of the world. However, it is nearly impossible to remain isolated, and rely heavily on the owned resources. Therefore, the gravity of the situation demands to meet rapidly changing trends and focused on acquiring more wealth.",6.5,"“To start with, although there are scores of nations that are considered as huge economies whether due to their abundant natural resources or growth.” (This sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main subject or verb.)

I believe that people can satisfy with the factors such as quality of life, desirable dreams, and public facilities. In the following paragraphs, the reasons why I disagree will be proposed with examples.

To begin with, living in wealthy countries is beneficial for some reasons. Firstly, more population will improve their quality of life if governments have good employees that can manage their work process. This means that citizens can work or study without worrying about financial problems. Secondly, local communities will have opportunities to present their traditional cultures which can attract foreign travellers to visit them. To illustrate, those local communities can have high salaries if they sell souvenirs and food, and they can use that money to support themselves, such as travelling to desirable destinations. Lastly, some companies might make investments in nations that have economic growth, and those nations can provide public facilities, such as public transportation and public healthcare, using money from investments for their residents.

The factors stated above pave the way for my conclusion. In my opinion, if the management of the rich countries is good enough, circumstances such as economic wealth can make their populations satisfy. However, governments should care about the mental health and life expectancy of citizens rather than anything.",6.5,"“I believe that people can satisfy with the factors such as quality of life, desirable dreams, and public facilities.” fragment “Some specialists believe that there is no satisfaction for citizens if their countries are already wealthy.

"There are those who argue that when a nation is already rich, any additional growth in its economy will not make its citizens more gratified. However. I completely do not coincide with the same view.

To begin with, the nation's economic growth will open a vast of work opportunities to people in the working community as it attracts more local and foreign investors. For instance, a famous shoe company will open a branch in a particular country. Therefore, it needs high numbers of employees to fill vacant and available job positions. Consequently, more people will get more chances and opportunities to be employed and some might even get promoted. Hence, more job opportunities mean more satisfaction for the citizen of a country. 

In addition, by having  growth in the economy, people in the community will push themselves more to work together. As they can see the positive outcome of their camaraderie with each other. Study shows that if residents in a community or country are harmoniously working together, not only do they get a sense of companionship but also a more harmonious relationship. Hence, they feel more gratified and more encouraged to work with each other. Since they not only get personal benefits out of it but as well as they can help  their economy to grow.

To conclude, a country's growing economy may pose great work opportunities and job vacancies within a nation. As local and foreign investors will be enticed to open a branch of their product in a certain country. On top of that, it can be a ladder to success for the residents as well. As they can be promoted to a higher positions. Furthermore, there are studies that showed that people in a  nation can be stirred up more to form a harmonious relationship with each other as they can see the great benefit of it.",6.5,"“However.

"The richness of the country is one of the indexes for measuring the economic wealth of the country and this is connected with the satisfaction of people who live in it. Some argue that the trend in which people decrease their political and economic complaints as the country is getting richer. On the other hand, others believe the movement of eagerness to get advanced success more than their needs lets people be down. In my opinion, I show that too much seeking to become rich makes people distrust the country and unmatch their needs.

Firstly, growth is not the thing that always needs to be prioritised.

For developing countries, financial growth or getting a larger scale business platform is one of the emergency tasks which the country has to go through, however, developed countries already have the stable financial resource and can focus on other factors for their individuals more than success as the country which means the country which does not need to be worried about their financial vulnerability have more choice to spend their resource to develop next-step structures such as welfare, environment, and human rights. Facing an adequate social level step allows the country to grow in a proper way.

Additionally, the purpose of the governmental policy is based on the needs of the citizens, moreover, these policies should be aimed at solving the issues or matching what they want the country to be on the premise. It means that a policy which does not follow local preferences can not make people more satisfied, furthermore, there is a possibility of losing their trust in the government.

In conclusion, the richness of the country is premised on people's desires such as economic growth or getting out of a poor situation. Therefore, a policy which ignores what people want would negatively work on their trust in the government and reduce the motivation of workers.",6.5,"“Firstly, growth is not the thing that always needs to be prioritized.” (This sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main subject or verb.)

 As a result, they would be disappointed with their lives. For instance, the people in South Africa compare their country to an economic and modern country with high economic wealth. In addition, they are not joyful in their lives even if their country has a lot of natural resources 

On the other hand, if their country becomes increasingly involved in a business project, that will increase the availability of jobs with high salaries. Moreover, their lives are better than those of people who live in developing countries due to the additional wealth they have in industries like a business. For example, in 2019, the entire world faced COVID-19, and some economies dropped, whereas others, such as Saudi Arabia, controlled their economies in vaccines and medical products, which had no effect on their budgets.

In conclusion, the economic wealth of the country is essentially improving. I believe that rich countries have more advantages for their citizens than poor countries. This will raise their salary, projects, and their lives, which they will satisfy in the future.",6.5,"“Nowadays, economic growth has become increasing in some countries.” (This sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb.)

"The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an hypothetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.

It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth is not so crucial for a rich country. People from countries such as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as funding for projects, well-organized cities,and  a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not feel a significant sense of satisfaction with the increase in their economy.

Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from countries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask for more funding for some start  up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money means more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museums and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obtain a lot of benefits.

"It has been observed that teenagers tend to discontinue their studies after completing them, instead of getting accepted into college. This scenario has several advantages and disadvantages, all of which will be discussed in detail.

Discussing the benefits of the above, the main advantage is that young people can learn about different cultures. What I mean by that is that when students travel the world during breaks, they learn about different traditions, languages and social skills. So, their lifestyle changes, and they become multilingual. In addition, students gain practical experience while working part-time. In other words, students learn how to manage their finances effectively, expand their understanding of business concepts, and explore opportunities for continued education. For example, a survey conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's admissions department showed that possessing all of these abilities enables students to outperform others academically.

Despite the benefits of this situation, it also has some implications. The most important reason is that students lose motivation. To account for this, the information in their head disappears within a year of graduating from high school. As a result, learners will struggle to acquire knowledge from new courses while pursuing their degree education. Moreover, gaps necessitate meticulous preparation. In detail, during this time, if they cannot find projects or jobs, he/she may experience serious problems such as anxiety. This could lead him/her to engage in illegal activities like theft and drug use.

In summary, it can be said that every situation has both advantages and disadvantages. It is a fair idea to take a break and find your major before choosing a university course; however, without executing a perfect plan, learners lose focus on their studies and work.",6.5,"“To account for this, the information in their head disappears within a year of graduating from high school.”: fragment “It has been observed that teenagers tend to discontinue their studies after completing them, instead of getting accepted into college.”: run-on",,
"In the past few days, the topic of whether rich countries should provide economic assistance to poor countries or if other forms of assistance can help solve poverty problems has sparked heated discussions in society. Some people believe that offering financial assistance is the most effective way to combat poverty, whereas others contend that targeted aid in other areas would be more beneficial for impoverished nations. I believe that providing other forms of aid can help to address the root causes of poverty in developing countries.

On the one hand, rich countries can provide material assistance to poor countries by providing food, drinking water, and other specific items that meet the basic needs of impoverished individuals. This improves their quality of life and addresses the issue of poverty. Moreover, the international community can send economists to poor countries as heads of finance departments to provide effective economic advice. In this manner, underdeveloped nations can advance their economies and reduce poverty. In addition, other countries can send technical personnel to less developed countries or provide technical assistance by exporting technical equipment and establishing local factories directly. This will increase industrial output and promote economic prosperity. This helps less-developed countries to eliminate poverty and backwardness.

On the other hand, providing economic assistance to poor and underdeveloped countries can help them purchase daily necessities or other materials that can alleviate poverty. However, while such assistance may temporarily alleviate poverty, it cannot fundamentally reverse the challenging situation in the country.

Generally speaking, developed countries provide more substantial aid to impoverished nations, which can better address the issue of poverty in these regions.",6.5,"“On the one hand, rich countries can provide material assistance to poor countries by providing food, drinking water, and other specific items that meet the basic needs of impoverished individuals.” (This sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb.)

"These days gap year between school and university has been increasingly taking a grip in many countries. However, it has a lot of benefits such as work experience and having knowledge about a new language and culture, it has to confront with negatives like losing interest and poor utilization of money.


An argument in favour of taking a year off than continuing tertiary education is it offers valuable work experience. Many students do a part-time or full-time job in order to earn money so that they can persist their further studies. Consequently, not only do such initiatives give good work experience, but also added in their curriculum vitae. Knowing the new culture and language is another imperative aspect of travelling overseas. Most students generally prefer to travel abroad for a short period of time before entering into university as it provides them with a chance to interpret new tradition and language, which is undeniably fruitful in future career prospects by being bilingual aspirants.


There are many drawbacks of having a year off. The majority of youngsters have inclined to lose their interest since the significant purpose of the tertiary study is getting a well-paid job to satisfy their basic needs. However, accumulating funds while part-time job makes them able to fulfil their demands. As a result, they quit their studies. Moreover, such funds make them enable them to use in bad activities such as gambling, drinks and drugs. For example, a recent poll by the UK government reveals that 60% of total students who are independent got addicted to bad influences.

"In most countries, teenagers often travel or do a part-time or full-time job for a certain period of time before entering the university. The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.
One of a positive side of taking a gap before continuing higher education is getting a valuable work experience by doing part-time or full-time employment. It is true that in many countries a candidate with no experience always struggles to get a good job after finishing tertiary education, whereas, a candidate who has a small experience before entering university often does not struggle to get a job in future. Another positive aspect is saving of some fund. This is because the higher education is so costly that most students do not continue their education, and with such savings not only do they continue their studies, but also do not have to depend on their parents or bank for a loan.
There are many negative sides to this but one of them is losing interest to continue the studies. For example, in China, 65% of students who took a gap of 6 months or a year never came back for their further education due to an interest in earning money. Another downside is that getting involved in bad activities. It has seen in many western countries that few students who travel or work for a certain period seem to get involved in bad influences such as, drugs, shoplifting or robbery.
In conclusion, even though travelling or doing the job for some period gives an opportunity to have work experience and a small saving, downsides to this is showing an interest for earning money rather than continuing study further.",6.5,"“The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.” (This sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb.)

"These days, it is observed that the school student after completing this schooling opted to travel or work for a short period of time rather than directly entering into university. This essay closely monitors the benefits as well as drawbacks of such decision of students.

When the student after leaving school decides to work or travel then there are chances that once they begin to earn money, they may not prefer to engage themselves again in studies and this would not initially trouble them, but in later stage of life if they get experienced in a particular field, they might not have fair chances of promotion compared to those having less exposure and higher degree of education.

On the contrary, if the young adults travel and have work experience in the field of their interest before pursuing for university helps them in knowing people and managing their needs well. It provides them with the real life experience which helps them to make better and mature decisions in life. For instance, a student pursuing pharmacy has worked in a pharmacy store before joining college will help him with his studies as after working he might get more familiar with name and uses of medicines.

Also, working prior to entering university may provide supportive amount of money while paying fees, especially for middle class family.

In a nutshell, it can be said that if the school leaver travels or works before pursuing higher education, it helps in knowing his interest and obtain real world experience bit at the same time one should not refrain from joining back to university even though they start earning handful amount of money.",6.5,"“On the contrary, if the young adults travel and have work experience in the field of their interest before pursuing for university helps them in knowing people and managing their needs well.”:  fragment",,

"Interviews are commonly used as a way to screen candidates at large companies. However, some people argue that interviews are not an effective way to recruit employees. I agree that relying on interviews alone can lead to hiring the wrong professional. However, I believe that when used in combination with other assessment methods, such as group activities and quizzes, interviews can be a valuable tool in the hiring process.

 

Organisations are increasingly using group activities to assess applicants’ suitability for their roles. This allows them to see how potential employees react under pressure and how they handle conflict. These simulations give organisations a better understanding of the professional’s values, behaviours and thinking patterns. As candidates often lie in the interview and tend to act like robots answering the questions the way the recruiter expects, the information gathered in the group work can then be used alongside interview results to make final hiring decisions.

 

Secondly, personality quizzes can be a useful tool for assessing job seekers' profiles and determining their strengths and weaknesses. Such tests can help to identify which aspirants are naturally good mediators and which ones will require more direction from others. If one of the criteria for the role is to hire someone with strong leadership skills, then mediators may be the best option.

"As the economy is advancing by leaps and bounds, the attitude people adopt towards recruitment has undergone a noticeable and far-reaching transformation. Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether there are other effective alternatives to interviews which have been fundamental choosing standards. For my part, I side with the advocates to a larger extent based on the following sound reasons.

Firstly, it is noteworthy that conversations fail to make a comprehensive assessment of job-seekers. Nowadays, many studies have shown that although it is invisible, the meeting in person can not make the evaluation of the honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness of applicants because of limited interaction in a short period of time. Therefore, it will be a grave mistake to overlook the fact that interviews are not the most dependable method for recruitment. For example, in some countries where employers give high weight to whole-life employment, reference from current employees is widely applied to recruit new staff rather than public advertisement and interviews. This example is the illustration of the fact that talking is not a totally reliable method for some inherited shortcomings.

Secondly, the counter-argument raised by objectors is that without meeting job-seekers can not show off their abilities, and experiences. This belief could be attributed to the fact that in large measure, conversations have been widely used to check the richness of capabilities such as interpersonal interaction skills, resilience and critical thinking skill via giving questions and requiring immediate answers. This argument is true to some degree; however, it is incomplete, what they fail to take into account is that meetings can not go further to check criminal records or bank credit. For instance, according to some research, when it comes to fulfilling vacancies for managers, directors, and chief officers; most companies are inclined to use services provided by head-hunting companies because these companies are specialized in seeking highly qualified workers with special tools, professional means.

In conclusion, I am convinced that there are more productive methods to recruit new personnel than interviews for the reasons mentioned above.

"Different eminent companies think interview is a satisfaction method for basic selection. However, there are those who say that interview is not a perfect system of choosing employees as well as there are other better methods. I completely believe that interview process is the best way in this essay. I will examine my point of view. 

Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why I believe that phenomenon. Perhaps the main reason is that communication skill, confidence and group working mentality can be understood by taking interview. Moreover, some people do not feel comfortable when they communicate with others. For example, in sales and marketing job workers should have good communication skills to persuade customers by giving advertise about their product. Furthermore, in multinational job, people have to do work in a group.there may have foreign people. so in that case, communication is the most crucial skill. 

Another reason why I believe with this statement is that fundamental skill. there are some company where workers need basic skill and good knowledge about their sector. In addition, the owner can check their portfolio and ask basic questions by face to face interview. For instance, in it related job, the workers need basic cognition in programming. If they have this learning, , they have to have a good portfolio and LinkedIn ID .So the holder of the company can check it.

"Many multinational companies conduct interviews in order to select the best candidates for their organisation. Although it may be argued that interviews are not a reliable method of selecting a person for a job, I agree with the premise and will substantiate my reasons in the course of this essay.

     The expression ""First impression, is the best impression"" comes to mind here because this is what interviews are basically about. A company gets many applications for any given job requirement. Therefore in order to ""thin out the herd"", firms hold these formal discussions so as to gauge the interviewees. Moreover, this way the interviewer will also be able to assess the technical know-how of the applicant and his expectations. In addition, the temperament of the applicant can be assessed along with his communication level. The communication level is a very important aspect of a job because there may be situations where a potential employee needs to speak to senior-level managers, and if they are unable to convey their message in a simplistic manner, then the message gets lost.

         Furthermore, it is an opportunity for the company to provide a potential employee with their expectations of them, and also through these discussions help them to determine whether the applicant will suit their working environment. Also, through a face to face interview, interviewers can get to know through the body language and facial expressions the exact intent of the applicant. This is very important and cannot be obtained from a resume.

         To conclude, I believe that interviews are important from a company's perspective for obtaining the best employee for their requirement. As they are going to be paying for their services in terms of salaries, it is only fair that they get to see the potential employee and understand their capabilities.",6.5,"As they are going to be paying for their services in terms of salaries, it is only fair that they get to see the potential employee and understand their capabilities.: Fragment

"In the modern world, traditionally, in order to get a job in a good place, people need to go through a series of interviews. This practice is quite universal and many companies use it. Despite everything, this method has a number of disadvantages and advantages. In spite of the advantages, I think a meeting is a good path.

Advocates of the method believe that today at the time, when a huge number of people are fighting for equality and diversity, a universal approach  to recruiting can be the key to a successful business. Another good thing about interviews is HR specialists should not prepare to examine every candidate  separately. It makes the process  of recruiting more simple and faster.  And finally, the third reason why conferences are a fine practice for future employees can make ready and answer some common questions before face-to-face communication and it helps them to be more confident and relaxed during the interview.

There are, however, some disadvantages. Common approaches for recruiting may not take into account the personal qualities of a job applicant. A talented but timid  person may suffer from such an interview where he or she will feel uncomfortable. Another bad thing in the interview is monotony. A lot of men and women say the same things day after day. Either because it is taught in the courses, or because humans  think that it will be better if they say common phrases, however, it often happens that a person goes through a dozen interviews in different companies, but does not find a job.

In my opinion, there are maybe better ways of tackling this problem. For instance, HR specialists can approach recruiting in a more personalized way.

"Many multinational and national companies select their staff after a lot of research. In that face to face interaction is the prime site for an employee hiring. Although, it is considered by few that interview is not an appropriate way of filling the vacancy and there are more reliable sources. However, I mostly disagree with the view. My point  is justified further.

If it was easy to crack an interview of reputed establishments, then everyone might had got a place in each corporation. Moreover, it is not a piece of cake for all, it needs courage, dedication along with proper knowledge because all true colours flow out in front of interviewers. One of the many criteria judged is, crammed theory. For example, when a person is given a complicated situation and asked how will they put their learning into an action. Such is the time when the stars start surrounding around the head, because all they remember is what the theory says, but do not know the real life application of that intelligence. Thus, the individual gets rejected as they do not need a book, but a human engine to run their machines. Furthermore, other criteria to qualify is, communication skills. For example, if a product is needed to be sold, then the buyers should be provided with as best offer as possible, just for company profit. Whatever, the business it is running, the best way to buy or sell products is negotiation with the way of talking and persuading them with some schemes. In addition, introsceptiner also notes the practical exposure and change of facial express. For example, expressions like lies, fear, worry, anxiety and the capability of a man.

 The capability of a person is also judged by his past interest and achievements until now.

On the contrary, the era has changed and continuation of age old methods of employee acceptance needs a change. This can be bought by replacing the system with either  questionnaire pamphlet or multiple short tests. For example, all the interviewing  questions, exam can be taken or else multiple different field exam.

"The increase in the production of consumer goods has detrimental effects on the natural environment, primarily due to several interconnected causes. One major factor is the overconsumption and demand for disposable products, leading to excessive resource extraction, pollution, and waste generation. Fast fashion, electronic gadgets, and single-use plastics contribute significantly to environmental degradation.

Additionally, the use of non-renewable resources in manufacturing processes, such as fossil fuels and raw materials, intensifies the environmental impact. Extracting these resources often involves destructive practices, further compromising ecosystems.

To address this issue, a multifaceted approach is essential. Firstly, there should be a shift towards sustainable production and consumption practices. Companies can adopt eco-friendly manufacturing processes, utilize recycled materials, and design products with longevity in mind. Governments can implement and enforce regulations that promote environmental responsibility in manufacturing.

Consumer awareness and education play a crucial role. Encouraging individuals to make informed and sustainable choices, such as supporting eco-friendly brands and opting for durable goods, can significantly reduce the demand for environmentally harmful products.

Innovations in technology also offer solutions. For instance, the development of biodegradable materials, advancements in recycling technologies, and the promotion of a circular economy can help mitigate the negative impact of consumer goods production.

An example of a positive shift is the growing popularity of sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical sourcing, eco-friendly materials, and transparency in their production processes. Such initiatives demonstrate that it is possible to align consumerism with environmental consciousness.

In conclusion, addressing the environmental damage caused by the production of consumer goods requires a comprehensive approach involving sustainable practices in manufacturing, government regulations, consumer awareness, and technological innovations.

In order to face the increasing number of productions, thousands of factories are established to enhance production and promote revenue. Most of those take advantage of fossil fuels to generate power for the use of production. Nevertheless, it would contribute to an amount of toxic air pollution and discharge sewage. More specifically, the factories not only pose a threat to people’s physical health but also contaminate the quality of air. Therefore, despite the fact that more factories can improve production efficiency, it influences our environment and deteriorates air quality.

One of the problems is that, in the last one hundred years the world has developed a lot and nowadays with all the advancements in technology it has become cheaper and quicker to produce all types of  goods; such as clothes, plastic materials, and everyday gadgets. Secondly, most people, especially those living in first-world countries can afford to buy almost anything they need to have a comfortable life. Although this  sounds like something positive for human livelihood, unfortunately in the long term the consequences of excessive production and waste can be catastrophic for the global environment. Furthermore, because of the excessive pollution, we are suffering climate change at a more rapid rate and seeing more severe natural disasters as a consequence.

A possible solution for this issue would be to make the younger generations more conscious of the consequences of human consumerism and its impact on the planet. For example, students could be thought how to take care of  nature in their first grades of schooling. Another beneficial option would be to take students of all ages to pick up waste in parks and beaches around their community, therefore educating not only them but all their families. As a result, we would have better-educated generations that in the future will be able to take care of the health of the world and possibly reduce or even control the heating of the globe.

In summary, this critical state that  nature is facing today is mainly a consequence of the excessive production of things that end up in landfills. Generally, the fast-paced development of the world production of goods, better affordability and unawares ness is the reason for this issue to be occurring. Thus, what might be an effective solution to prevent further damage to the environment would be to focus on educating young kids so they can pass it on to future generations.",6.5,,,
"In this day and age, as the more consumer goods are manufactured, the more damage has been inflicted on the environment. This essay will discuss some of the main reasons that cause this problem such as discharging the factory wastes to the environment and increasing the usage of single-use materials which are harmful to  nature. As for some solutions to this problem, imposing strict laws related to discharging wastes and promoting the use of echo-friendlier materials can be mentioned.

Factories use raw materials to manufacture any type of goods that are needed for the people. Producing always has some wastes and as production is increased, there will be more swages and toxic wastes released in nature. These chemical by-products from manufacturing can harm both marine and terrestrial animals and also can be harmful to any kind of plant and tree. The increase in demand and usage of single-use goods  is another reason for this problem. These days, most  people struggle with hectic life routines which lead them to prefer using single-use material as a time-saving choice in different situations. For instance, if someone wants to throw a party, he or she will choose to use disposable tableware rather than cutlery. Despite the short lifespan of these products, they will remain as wastes in nature for hundreds of years which may lead earth to a huge landfill and put all species in danger.

That said, certain measures could be taken to decrease the harm to the environment while the manufacturing of goods is increasing. First, governments should impose strict laws for factories related to the ways in which wastes are discharged. For instance, if the wastes of a factory are more than a defined and acceptable one, they should be punished and be forced to pay for the loss. Second, manufacturers should make eco-friendlier goods and also encourage people to use these types of products. As a good step toward this solution, Starbucks has made reusable paper and bamboo mugs that are used instead of plastic ones. 

All things considered, recently, there are some works done by humans which cause harm to the nature, such as increasing the amount of consumer goods production. This essay discussed two main reasons for this problem, which included how wastes were abandoned in nature and the increase in the usage of single-use materials. Also, as for solutions to this problem, having laws for how to dispose the factory sewage and encouraging society to use the organic materials were suggested.",6.5,"As a good step toward this solution, Starbucks has made reusable paper and bamboo mugs that are used instead of plastic ones.: Fragment

"t is maintained by some that students execute better when in a single-gender school, compared to a co-educational environment. However, in my opinion enrolling children in a mixed school is of utmost importance as it prepares them for the real world.

To begin with, co-educational institutes allow pupils to develop their team working and interpersonal skills. Teamwork provides ample opportunities for the students to interact and work together, which is completely lacking in single-sex schools. This can have a positive impact as at the present competitive market, employers are keener to hire individuals who can incorporate team spirit and social skills. In other words, when both the genders are able to communicate effectively and comfortably to achieve a task together, they have better career prospects in the future.

Another point to consider is that children are able to acquire a deeper understanding of the opposite gender and their views. As boys and girls have a different outlook on life, they can learn and benefit from each other in a coeducational setting. For instance, students assigned to work on a group project, can see aspects from a different angle and perspective, which results in a more positive outcome.

Finally, being taught together encourages competition between genders, which can often give rise to better results. In a competitive learning environment, students are more driven to succeed and surpass one another to achieve the desires outcomes. The majority of boys in co-educational schools perform better academically compared to the ones in same-sex schools, due to the fear of bad grades and feeling inferior in front of their female counterparts.

In conclusion, I believe mixed schools are better for the youngsters in the long run, particularly career-wise as it mirrors the real world much more closely than single gender schools.",6.5,"However, in my opinion enrolling children in a mixed school is of utmost importance as it prepares them for the real world.: Run-on

Although they feel distracted, there are a lot of courses that students need to cover, and I will discuss possible solutions for improving their concentration in the upcoming paragraphs. 

Firstly, the main reason that the students are unable to attention to study is that they feel fear because of the extra syllabus as they feel they are unable to finish on time. For instance, most learners prefer to complete topics which are easy as otherwise they feel a stress on mind to finish it. Secondly, children love to spend time on the internet where they play video games up to late at night which is the main distraction as they are unable to get proper sleep due to which they have lack of energy to focus on their studies. 

The prominent solution for improving the curiosity of students towards their studies is that they make proper time for sleep which helps for the proper functioning of the brain. Elders have to make strict rules regarding the playing time of the kids so they get enough time to complete the homework as well as get time to revise class work.

"It is true that many children find it difficult to focus on the course at school. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon, so we need to take a comprehensive approach to mitigate it.

On the one hand, several factors contribute to this aissue. One of the reasons is the development of technology such as the applications of smartphones. With smartphones, many students are addicted to the virtual world brought about by mobile games and gain a sense of achievement

, which cannot be found in schools. The influence of the environment is another main reason. For example, if the juveniles around them behave badly in schools like talking to others or sleeping in classes without being punished by teachers, which may have a bad impact on them and they may imitate this behaviour, leading to their lack of focus on their school work.

However, many measures can be taken to solve this problem. To begin with, parents can take children to do some outdoor activities such as kite flying and hiking. They are good ways for juveniles to get close to nature and be away from the virtual world. Then the children may understand the beauty of the real world. Furthermore, improving teaching quality is also important, which means teachers can make their teaching content more abundant to increase the opportunity for interaction with students. For instance, teachers should introduce more entertaining activities in classes such as brainstorming and group discussions. By doing so, the minors can focus more on the course at schools.

In conclusion, the development of technology and the influence of the environment are the main reasons why it is difficult for students to catch the course at school, but actions should be taken along several aspects through doing outdoor activities and heightening teaching quality.",6.5,"With smartphones, many students are addicted to the virtual world brought about by mobile games and gain a sense of achievement.: Fragment

"No doubt, education needs proper attention and focus however these days a number of school-going students are unable to pay full concentration to their studies due to a lack of interest and feeling bored. In this ,  essay I will briefly explain the reason behind this trend and some possible solutions to overcome  this problem in the upcoming paragraphs.

Commence with the major cause behind this issue is they spend a maximum of hours on their cellphone at night while playing games as a result they feel lazy and sleep during school time  .Needless to say, due to parents' careless attitude towards their offspring lead this problem is rising rapidly nowadays. Secondly, the way of teaching also plays a very significant part in academics if the teacher just explains the textbook part without an example then children definitely feel inactive during study time .Apart from this , an unhealthy diet is the third main reason behind this problem .This is because nowadays teenagers love to eat junk food rather than healthy meals.Thus they face many problems while doing studies like eye pain , head pain and many other disorders. 

Although  these are the main problems which can be tackled by the parents and teacher support. First and foremost , parents have to fix their hours  to use smartphones , so that children can sleep early and complete their naps properly. Hence , they do not feel lazy and sleep in school . In fact , the school management has to Change their teaching ways  in which they involve practical work and add different examples to make children interested, thus students enjoy the way of learning and easily grab a topic knowledge. Additionally, parents should make food at home instead of ordering from outside so that students eat healthy food and stay fit and fine .Therefore , these things help to make the force on the education.

Nevertheless, the authorities should arrange the students and teachers meetings every weekend by that they can resolve their problems. Moreover, they should keep separate classes for the smarter students so that the lecturer can give full time to one who is lacking behind.

"In evaluating whether a surge in economic wealth in affluent countries directly correlates with heightened citizen satisfaction, I tend to disagree with the notion that additional economic prosperity fails to enhance the contentment of the populace.

While it's argued that increased economic wealth in already affluent nations doesn't significantly impact citizen satisfaction, I contend that such growth does play a pivotal role in improving the overall well-being and happiness of individuals. Firstly, heightened economic prosperity often leads to an augmented quality of life for citizens. It provides better access to essential services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, which are integral to improving the living standards of the population.

Moreover, economic growth in affluent countries can facilitate greater employment opportunities and higher incomes for individuals. A thriving economy fosters innovation and job creation, subsequently improving citizens' financial security and providing them with a sense of stability and satisfaction.

Additionally, economic growth enables societies to invest in technological advancements and infrastructure, resulting in increased convenience and efficiency in daily life. Advancements in technology often lead to improvements in various aspects of life, from communication to transportation, contributing to citizens' convenience and overall satisfaction.

Furthermore, a prosperous economy empowers governments to address societal challenges and invest in social welfare programs. These initiatives assist marginalized communities, reduce inequality, and promote social cohesion, crucial elements that contribute to citizens' contentment and happiness.

In conclusion, while some argue that increased economic wealth in affluent nations doesn't necessarily elevate citizen satisfaction, I firmly believe that economic growth significantly contributes to improving living standards, providing opportunities, fostering innovation, and addressing social issues. Hence, continued economic progress remains instrumental in enhancing the overall satisfaction and well-being of citizens in wealthy countries.",6.5,"Furthermore, a prosperous economy empowers governments to address societal challenges and invest in social welfare programs.: Fragment

"In contemporary society, some people think that wealth is the main factor which makes it possible for individuals' well-being, but others argue this idea. Therefore, although some nations are already rich and bring about the addition of economic wealth which increases, citizens in the countries do not feel more satisfied. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversy, and my opinion will be provided.

On the one hand, advocates of this perspective believe that even if arises  stable finance in nations that are already rich, it does not help the population in this country be more pleased. It is clear that economics is not a major determiner that allows people to pleasure in living. In other words, some regions may lack a variety of conveniences such as amusements, transport, and other facilities.

On the other hand, those against the idea of people in the rich countries feel that are not satisfied, despite  additional increases in finance. The reason is that the more there is budget in the countries, the more there is comfortable living because the budget is a foundation of development. Furthermore, the government will spend this fund on the generation of places which satisfy individuals, and they can provide a lot of supplies such as food and materials. As a result, the high-income regions can bring about benefits for citizens.

In conclusion, some researchers believe that  wealthy nations do not cause the population to feel more comfortable. In my view, I strongly disagree with this issue because money is a basic part of life.",6.5,,,
"Some professionals think that the residents will not satisfied with any additional growth in the economy since this nation is already wealthy. In my opinion, I firmly disagree with this statement because while there is a limit that money can bring to us, the increase in economic wealth still makes the citizens more delightful.

First of all, one of the reasons why I think the enhancement of Economic wealth still makes people happy is because there will more problems to tackle. As a result of the countries being rich, there will more issues will exist especially about the social. For instance, nowadays, the authorities and the residents need to face traffic congestion and pollution as a consequence of people will tend to buy more and more cars than ever, if the nation is rich, they can supply and encourage their populations to commute by vehicles which use environmentally friendly energy. Moreover, if the country is wealthy, it can provide the latest technology in many categories such as healthcare and education which makes people’s satisfaction grow. 

In contrast, sometimes economic growth will not make people more cheerful cause of the rise of the nation’s economy just a part of their life besides their well-being and relationships. For example, while a person is vibrant, they are a patient who is facing an illness that can not be treated so they will not have true satisfaction. In addition, we used to have money to meet our necessary needs such as food and a place to live, so when all our needs are supplied we will not care about money anymore.

In conclusion, I can't entirely agree with the statement that the citizens will not satisfied with the economic growth due to the fact that they have used to it because there will be more problems in a developed country than usual so we need money to solve it and also the government can supply the best things for their residents’s essential needs in life.",6.5,"As a result of the countries being rich, there will more issues will exist especially about the social.: Fragment

"Preservation of old vintage buildings in  cities requires a huge amount of money from the government and this money can be utilized to build new infrastructures. My standpoint is old buildings should be restored not for utilization but to be preserved as heritage.

Preserving old buildings is one of the expensive expenses of the state and every year a lot of money is needed to restore them. There are several reasons behind this restoration and the most prominent one is their historical values. Moreover, old buildings not only have an artistic appeal but also  are long-lasting. If we preserve them properly they can serve us for more hundred years. I personally believe that, if old houses are given proper care and maintenance they will serve us with the specific  purpose they are used for. Furthermore, they will enhance the beauty of the cities with vintage ambience and will attract more tourists. For example, the city of Melbourne is still using so many restored buildings from the past and they provide a beautiful vintage feeling.

In modern city lives,  using a lot of money to build new houses and roads is necessary. Although old buildings can be used for several purposes new houses needed to be built to fulfil other purposes. Modern city life can not be confined only to old buildings and roads  new ones are needed. However, it is difficult for the government to preserve old ones and create new infrastructures. It can be possible if the government properly utilizes the resources and manpower it has. Government and citizens should work hand in hand to build new ones and restore old ones.

To conclude, preserving old buildings can be expensive but because of their appeal and values government should get concerned to ensure proper preservation and utilization of them.",6.5,,,
"Nowadays, the pressing need to provide shelter for the community is a mainstream issue being addressed by the government. However, the capital invested into construction renovation is huge compared with the cost of original housing development. I couldn’t have agreed more that this amount should rather be used for modern expansion alongside transportation routes. Analyzing the need for urbanization and the effect of construction retrofitting will justify it.

Firstly, more than half of the society's population lacks a home in developing countries thereby encouraging human habitation in slums, where they have always been exposed to environmental disasters such as floods, outbreaks of diseases, and insecurities. For instance, urban cities across the world have been experiencing congestion due to overcrowding. Hence, erecting lodges in areas that are yet to be developed will be more advantageous to society.

Secondly, of,course the approach of retrofitting as an alternative to building construction may be cheaper, particularly in the case of smaller projects. Yet, the risk attached to the processes involved could incur more costs. For example, the demolition of structural elements of the existing buildings, if not handled by experts could lead to vehement loss and even death, contrary to the budget. Thus restructuring of housing should best be considered as the last result of expanding housing.

In a nutshell, the government's record of a large amount for developing readymade houses as against contemporary homes and access roads, calls for the need to consider the option of investment with respect to project size and expertise.",6.5,,,
"Some are of the belief that we should adapt to and coexist with the effects rather than focus on preventing climate change. I’m in disagreement with the former, as there are other purposes for preventing climate change.

Firstly, those who feel the environment's effect can be adapted and accepted are a form of lack of respect and indifference to nature a nd there are reasons  to prevent  the potential scale of the impacts  of climate change. extreme weather events pose significant risks to the ecosystem, human health, and the global economy. This situation can be overcome by taking proactive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We  can mitigate these risks and work towards a more sustainable and resilient future.

In addition, the act of mitigating climate change is in accordance with the fundamental tenets of sustainability and responsible management of the environment. It is incumbent upon us to assume the duty of safeguarding the Earth and its finite resources for the benefit of forthcoming generations. Adopting a perspective of adapting to the impacts of climate change while neglecting to confront its fundamental drivers would demonstrate a limited perspective and have adverse consequences for the future welfare of both human beings and the Earth. Through collaborative efforts aimed at mitigating climate change, nations can cultivate global collaboration and achieve substantial progress in the pursuit of a sustainable future.

In conclusion, accepting climate change rather than working to stop it is a mistake. Prevention is paramount, thus, we must cut emissions of greenhouse gases, switch to renewable energy, and implement other sustainable practices.  By reducing these dangers, we can give future generations a better shot at a healthy and sustainable life.",6.5,,,
"The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an hypothetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.

It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth is not so crucial for a rich country. People from countries such as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens.

"It has been observed that teenagers tend to discontinue their studies after completing them, instead of getting accepted into college. This scenario has several advantages and disadvantages, all of which will be discussed in detail.

Discussing the benefits of the above, the main advantage is that young people can learn about different cultures. What I mean by that is that when students travel the world during breaks, they learn about different traditions, languages and social skills. So, their lifestyle changes, and they become multilingual. In addition, students gain practical experience while working part-time. In other words, students learn how to manage their finances effectively, expand their understanding of business concepts, and explore opportunities for continued education. For example, a survey conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's admissions department showed that possessing all of these abilities enables students to outperform others academically.

Despite the benefits of this situation, it also has some implications. The most important reason is that students lose motivation. To account for this, the information in their head disappears within a year of graduating from high school. As a result, learners will struggle to acquire knowledge from new courses while pursuing their degree education. Moreover, gaps necessitate meticulous preparation. In detail, during this time, if they cannot find projects or jobs, he/she may experience serious problems such as anxiety. This could lead him/her to engage in illegal activities like theft and drug use.

"In the past few days, the topic of whether rich countries should provide economic assistance to poor countries or if other forms of assistance can help solve poverty problems has sparked heated discussions in society. Some people believe that offering financial assistance is the most effective way to combat poverty, whereas others contend that targeted aid in other areas would be more beneficial for impoverished nations. I believe that providing other forms of aid can help to address the root causes of poverty in developing countries.

On the one hand, rich countries can provide material assistance to poor countries by providing food, drinking water, and other specific items that meet the basic needs of impoverished individuals. This improves their quality of life and addresses the issue of poverty. Moreover, the international community can send economists to poor countries as heads of finance departments to provide effective economic advice. In this manner, underdeveloped nations can advance their economies and reduce poverty. In addition, other countries can send technical personnel to less developed countries or provide technical assistance by exporting technical equipment and establishing local factories directly. This will increase industrial output and promote economic prosperity. This helps less-developed countries to eliminate poverty and backwardness.

On the other hand, providing economic assistance to poor and underdeveloped countries can help them purchase daily necessities or other materials that can alleviate poverty. However, while such assistance may temporarily alleviate poverty, it cannot fundamentally reverse the challenging situation in the country.

Generally speaking, developed countries provide more substantial aid to impoverished nations, which can better address the issue of poverty in these regions.",6.5,"However, while such assistance may temporarily alleviate poverty, it cannot fundamentally reverse the challenging situation in the country.: Fragment

"These days gap year between school and university has been increasingly taking a grip in many countries. However, it has a lot of benefits such as work experience and having knowledge about a new language and culture, it has to confront with negatives like losing interest and poor utilization of money.


An argument in favour of taking a year off than continuing tertiary education is it offers valuable work experience. Many students do a part-time or full-time job in order to earn money so that they can persist their further studies. Consequently, not only do such initiatives give good work experience, but also added in their curriculum vitae. Knowing the new culture and language is another imperative aspect of travelling overseas. Most students generally prefer to travel abroad for a short period of time before entering into university as it provides them with a chance to interpret new tradition and language, which is undeniably fruitful in future career prospects by being bilingual aspirants.


There are many drawbacks of having a year off. The majority of youngsters have inclined to lose their interest since the significant purpose of the tertiary study is getting a well-paid job to satisfy their basic needs. However, accumulating funds while part-time job makes them able to fulfil their demands. As a result, they quit their studies. Moreover, such funds make them enable them to use in bad activities such as gambling, drinks and drugs. For example, a recent poll by the UK government reveals that 60% of total students who are independent got addicted to bad influences.

"In most countries, teenagers often travel or do a part-time or full-time job for a certain period of time before entering the university. The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.
One of a positive side of taking a gap before continuing higher education is getting a valuable work experience by doing part-time or full-time employment. It is true that in many countries a candidate with no experience always struggles to get a good job after finishing tertiary education, whereas, a candidate who has a small experience before entering university often does not struggle to get a job in future. Another positive aspect is saving of some fund. This is because the higher education is so costly that most students do not continue their education, and with such savings not only do they continue their studies, but also do not have to depend on their parents or bank for a loan.
There are many negative sides to this but one of them is losing interest to continue the studies. For example, in China, 65% of students who took a gap of 6 months or a year never came back for their further education due to an interest in earning money. Another downside is that getting involved in bad activities. It has seen in many western countries that few students who travel or work for a certain period seem to get involved in bad influences such as, drugs, shoplifting or robbery.

When the student after leaving school decides to work or travel then there are chances that once they begin to earn money, they may not prefer to engage themselves again in studies and this would not initially trouble them, but in later stage of life if they get experienced in a particular field, they might not have fair chances of promotion compared to those having less exposure and higher degree of education.

On the contrary, if the young adults travel and have work experience in the field of their interest before pursuing for university helps them in knowing people and managing their needs well. It provides them with the real life experience which helps them to make better and mature decisions in life. For instance, a student pursuing pharmacy has worked in a pharmacy store before joining college will help him with his studies as after working he might get more familiar with name and uses of medicines.

Also, working prior to entering university may provide supportive amount of money while paying fees, especially for middle class family.

In a nutshell, it can be said that if the school leaver travels or works before pursuing higher education, it helps in knowing his interest and obtain real world experience bit at the same time one should not refrain from joining back to university even though they start earning handful amount of money.",6.5,"Also, working prior to entering university may provide supportive amount of money while paying fees, especially for middle class family.: Fragment

"There is no iota of doubt that, with the help of rapid growth in population and transportation in Urban areas leads to several problems, while higher authorities  influences many businesses migrate to some countryside areas. This phenomenon is offering multifarious benefits to Masses, However Sometimes a couple of problems emerge due to some.

Firstly, it will be harmful for native rural areas the producing material by firms if ever they can dispose unnecessary material in their lands. As a result, the quality of pure air Become bad and it also effect on the soil of fertilizers. Secondly, the business person may face loss due to unskilled employees hire from rural areas.

"The world has made massive progress in the field of communication and technology. Mobile phones and the internet provide numerous benefits to people of all age groups. However, it may be most useful to the elderly generation. Sadly, this generation uses these phones the least. This essay will discuss the various benefits of this technology and will also provide solutions to increase technological engagement among older folk.

To point out the benefits, the use of mobile phones can help with  boredom and loneliness. The majority of the crowd in this age group are retired and usually have a lot of time to kill .The usage of the internet with apps like WhatsApp and Facebook might keep them entertained and busy. For instance, a sixty-five-year-old granny can listen to her favourite music, hear religious sermons or play anything of her interest to avoid the feeling of loneliness. These portables are also advantageous as they contain numerous apps to help the  old crowd to inculcate a hobby. For instance, many people in their late 50s and early 60s are interested in gardening. There are various applications available on these machines which can help them perfect their skills. Thus, with the help of their machines, the older generation can spend their time more productively.

There are various simple steps that can be taken to encourage this. The younger generation can help the most. Every household has at least one aged person who needs help with using their technological devices. The younger generation should step in and explain these processes patiently. If the elder person's needs are met and if he or she is dealt with patiently, there will be an obvious increase in their usage of these devices. To give an example, I tend to teach my grandmother a new application every day on her phone which in turn is making her more tech-friendly by the day. Another step to help the problem can be taken by the mobile phone companies. Efforts should be made to launch phones which are designed especially for the use of the elderly . Many of these older users have weak eyesight and cannot hear properly. Thus, dial should be designed to suit their needs and make their experience more user-friendly. Some companies like Nokia are already setting an example. Nokia has introduced dial for the elderly with high-volume rings and low brightness which has increased the usage of Nokia products among the older generation.

In conclusion, one has to remember that science makes inventions for the benefit of the entire society. These aged citizens are also an integral part of our ecosystem. Their needs and wants should not be ignored and must be met with equal importance.",6.5,,note,

It is indubitable that the 21st century is a fast-paced world. Many technologies have been invented over the course of several decades to assist individuals in their day-to-day life. For existence, many fast food stores in Japan have self-service. With the help of these automated machines, the necessity to wait in a queue no longer exists. Orders can be placed at the touch of a button. There is no doubt that such gizmos may have had an impact on the patience of human beings. 

A commonly held consensus is the fact that this might affect humanity in a positive way. Delving deeper into the history of mankind, it could be noticed that an abundance of improvements in specific fields has been a result of inconvenience. A good case in point is the aeroplane. The creator of this major invention was bothered about how long it would take to travel to another country by boat. Consequently, he worked on a project inspired by the fleeting birds in the sky. Nowadays, thanks to this invention, trips to far places are no longer a nuisance. Coming to a thought based on this logic, a plethora of gadgets or creations can surface in the near future.

"The world today is experiencing uncertainties and unrest owing to multiple challenges posed by the confrontation between nations, rivalries among the superpowers, and recently climate change. However, it is argued that the public of certain nations cannot be convinced anymore with further addition of resources, since they already own plenty. This essay, instead, disagrees with such an idea as it is quite impossible to consider yourself accomplished.

To start with, although there are scores of nations that are considered as huge economies whether due to their abundant natural resources or growth.

Nevertheless, there exists not even a single country that is independent in terms of goods required to run the cycle of life and does not require any external assistance.  For instance, even the world power USA with enormous power and dominance is not safe and its economy is lingering and is on the verge of collapse as per some experts.

In addition, time and technology bring changes, and dependency on any single factor for survival is a disaster and an unwise decision. 

 As earlier said, any disturbance in the geopolitical lens tends to affect the whole world, the supply chain of commodity items, dollar rate, and raw material for industries each and everything is affected and those counties that are enriched are too prone to these vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is considered quite pivotal to have a continuous addition of resources in any form in order to cope with the challenges, which are increasingly becoming complex. Furthermore, such wealth can be utilized to help less developed countries as well. 

In a nutshell, nations develop themselves to build a strong reputation and lessen their dependency on the rest of the world. However, it is nearly impossible to remain isolated, and rely heavily on the owned resources. Therefore, the gravity of the situation demands to meet rapidly changing trends and focused on acquiring more wealth.",6.5,"To start with, although there are scores of nations that are considered as huge economies whether due to their abundant natural resources or growth.: Fragment

"The financial status of the country is a topic that has been widely discussed among many groups of people. Some specialists believe that there is no satisfaction for citizens if their countries are already wealthy. However, I would like to express my opinion that is different from those experts. I believe that people can satisfy with the factors such as quality of life, desirable dreams, and public facilities. In the following paragraphs, the reasons why I disagree will be proposed with examples.

To begin with, living in wealthy countries is beneficial for some reasons. Firstly, more population will improve their quality of life if governments have good employees that can manage their work process. This means that citizens can work or study without worrying about financial problems. Secondly, local communities will have opportunities to present their traditional cultures which can attract foreign travellers to visit them. To illustrate, those local communities can have high salaries if they sell souvenirs and food, and they can use that money to support themselves, such as travelling to desirable destinations. Lastly, some companies might make investments in nations that have economic growth, and those nations can provide public facilities, such as public transportation and public healthcare, using money from investments for their residents.

The factors stated above pave the way for my conclusion. In my opinion, if the management of the rich countries is good enough, circumstances such as economic wealth can make their populations satisfy. However, governments should care about the mental health and life expectancy of citizens rather than anything.",6.5,"In the following paragraphs, the reasons why I disagree will be proposed with examples.: Fragment

"There are those who argue that when a nation is already rich, any additional growth in its economy will not make its citizens more gratified. However. I completely do not coincide with the same view.

To begin with, the nation's economic growth will open a vast of work opportunities to people in the working community as it attracts more local and foreign investors. For instance, a famous shoe company will open a branch in a particular country. Therefore, it needs high numbers of employees to fill vacant and available job positions. Consequently, more people will get more chances and opportunities to be employed and some might even get promoted. Hence, more job opportunities mean more satisfaction for the citizen of a country. 

In addition, by having  growth in the economy, people in the community will push themselves more to work together. As they can see the positive outcome of their camaraderie with each other. Study shows that if residents in a community or country are harmoniously working together, not only do they get a sense of companionship but also a more harmonious relationship. Hence, they feel more gratified and more encouraged to work with each other. Since they not only get personal benefits out of it but as well as they can help  their economy to grow.

To conclude, a country's growing economy may pose great work opportunities and job vacancies within a nation. As local and foreign investors will be enticed to open a branch of their product in a certain country. On top of that, it can be a ladder to success for the residents as well. As they can be promoted to a higher positions.

"The richness of the country is one of the indexes for measuring the economic wealth of the country and this is connected with the satisfaction of people who live in it. Some argue that the trend in which people decrease their political and economic complaints as the country is getting richer. On the other hand, others believe the movement of eagerness to get advanced success more than their needs lets people be down. In my opinion, I show that too much seeking to become rich makes people distrust the country and unmatch their needs.

Firstly, growth is not the thing that always needs to be prioritised.

For developing countries, financial growth or getting a larger scale business platform is one of the emergency tasks which the country has to go through, however, developed countries already have the stable financial resource and can focus on other factors for their individuals more than success as the country which means the country which does not need to be worried about their financial vulnerability have more choice to spend their resource to develop next-step structures such as welfare, environment, and human rights. Facing an adequate social level step allows the country to grow in a proper way.

Additionally, the purpose of the governmental policy is based on the needs of the citizens, moreover, these policies should be aimed at solving the issues or matching what they want the country to be on the premise. It means that a policy which does not follow local preferences can not make people more satisfied, furthermore, there is a possibility of losing their trust in the government.

In conclusion, the richness of the country is premised on people's desires such as economic growth or getting out of a poor situation.

On one hand, some people are dissatisfied with the additional economic wealth in their country because they always compare it to another country or because their country increased in profits , which leads to increased goods and taxes.

Moreover, their lives are better than those of people who live in developing countries due to the additional wealth they have in industries like a business. For example, in 2019, the entire world faced COVID-19, and some economies dropped, whereas others, such as Saudi Arabia, controlled their economies in vaccines and medical products, which had no effect on their budgets.

"Some people are of the opinion that we should accept climate change and search ways in order to live with it instead of trying to prevent happening of this process. Personally, I do not agree with this view and I believe that all of us should make an effort to deal with this problem.

First and foremost, we must know that climate change and its consequences are very hazardous for our world and its ecosystem and mankind in many aspects. If governments give up due to costly expenditures to prevent temperature change, the states will have to spend more and more money to solve its results. For instance, glaciers which are located in the North Pole will melt, because of temperature rising all over the world. As a result, sea levels will rise both in oceans and seas and floods will happen. Thus, a majority of people lose their jobs and homes and therefore economy of governments can fail. Also, people have to migrate to other regions or cities and it leads to other types of problems. Such as, air pollution will go up significantly and it has harmful effects on the Ozone layer.

Due to climate change ,on the other hand, there will be drought in many fields. Therefore, the population can suffer from food shortages. Furthermore, biodiversity will be disrupted in the world, because of climate change. As a result, most of the animal and plant species will vanish into thin air and this has a negative impact on the food chain in nature. 

In conclusion, due to the reasons I mentioned above, I completely disagree with the statement that we should accept climate change. I believe that all of us do not have to give up taking preventative measures for climate change and we ought to protect the biodiversity of our world so as to live better.",6.5,,,
"Climate change has become a worldwide issue in recent years, there are some scientists who suggest that we should do nothing but find a way to live with it. In my opinion, I disagree with this view.

There are various measures that governments and individuals can take to prevent, or at least mitigate. For example, the governments can introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming. And they can impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters and invest in renewable energy production which use solar, wind or water power. In addition, individuals should limit our contribution to climate change. We can become more energy efficient , such as flying less, using bicycles and public transport. And the public  may affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change, rather than those who suggest to ignore it.

If instead of taking the above measures and simply trying to live with the climate change, the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, human cannot cope with the change that even a small rise in sea levels. It will cause millions of people getting displaced by flooding in countries without safeguard low-lying areas. People will lose their homes and their jobs and will be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. We may see outbreaks of disease and famine as well as increased homelessness and poverty.

In conclusion, I believe it is necessary to take climate change seriously, and we should not try to adapt to it.",6.5,,,
"Some people think they can find a way to live when the climate changed. Since any climate change may have severe consequences and humankind cannot cope with it, I completely disagree with this statement, and I think there is no way to live when you destroy the earth.

Firstly, salvaging the global climate is a challenging task, and almost we cannot do anything when our planet undergoes disruptive changes. We should consider that the earth is the only home that we have, and hence, it is impossible to move to another planet in the near future. Furthermore, if humans do not find any way to stop manipulating the climate, they will not be able to live here. But if we take care of the earth and let earth rescue itself, everything will return to its place within a few months. As, during the pandemic, some parts of the ozone layer recovered. In conclusion, In many cases, always preventing is better than the cure.

On the other hand, climate changes affect consequently on the different parts of the ecosystem. It has a lot of complex subsystems which affect other parts, and in many cases, we can not find out how they operate. For example, suppose the polar ice are destroyed. In that case, the level of water in the seas will rise, and there is a probability that many cities will drown, or if the ozone layer gets thinner, it may have adverse effects on agriculture. Therefore, we should take care of the earth; nevertheless, any change in the ecosystem and climate might have serious consequences that we may not find any solid solution for it.   

In conclusion, finding a new way of living when the climate has been changed is somehow unpractical because every change may have domino effects, and we do not have sufficient knowledge for salvaging and controlling these changes.",6.5,,,
"Climate change compels us to seek substitute energy sources and the only answer is renewable sources. Although few people support the idea of living with climate changes happening due to the overuse of energy sources, in my opine, these changes should be prevented to save the human race. In this essay, why the climate changes ought to be restricted instead of starting living with them, will be discussed.

To begin with, climate changes are occurring due to the overuse of natural resources and affecting the environment negatively. Using coal for the production of electricity has increased the carbon footprint and resulted in a surge in the average temperature of the earth. Besides, in many parts of the world, it leads to the destruction of the environment. For example, a study by the Queen's University has found that due to increase in the average temperature of the earth by 0.5 celcius has reduced glacier size by two lack metric tones in a single decade. Fluctuations in the normal temperature of the planet can affect not only the whole ecosystem but also the human race. Therefore, countries should restrict the uncapped use of non-renewable energy sources and assist in controlling the climate change.

Global warming is increasing day by day only because of uncontrolled human practices. Alternate energy sources for Vehicular and air traffic could help in curtain the adverse effect of pollution. Energy sources such as nuclear power, solar and wind power ought to be used instead of conventional sources. For instance, a report by the New York Times in 2021 has revealed that developing countries such as China and India are the main contributors to carbon emissions. Thirty-five percent of the electricity generation in the world comes from thermal power plants. Furthermore, the amplifying temperature of the atmosphere could melt glaciers of the Himalayas, and the Atlantic and lead to submerge of low lying areas of coastal regions. Hence, a slew of measures should be taken by countries to prevent climate change.

In conclusion, this essay supports the idea that  variation in weather patterns ought to be stopped to save the planet. Learning to live with the atmospheric changes could lead to unforeseen destruction of the planet.",6.5,"For example, a study by the Queen's University has found that due to increase in the average temperature of the earth by 0.5 celcius has reduced glacier size by two lack metric tones in a single decade.: Fragment

"It is often said by some individuals that human beings should accept climate change, rather than tackle the problem.  From my point of view, I strongly disagree with this idea because climate change is a life-threatening problem for all kinds of living species on earth.  In this essay, I will discuss this more in detail.

First of all, people's continuous carbon dioxide emissions will drastically lead to rising in temperatures.  And therefore, a rise in temperature will melt polar ice and cause floods in a lot of major coastal cities in different parts of the world.  Additionally, because the warming of the atmosphere affects weather patterns, people will suffer from more frequent severe storms and droughts across many global regions.

Secondly, changing climate will affect not only humans but also animals and ecosystems in the ocean as well.  Many animals have been facing the limit of where they can go to find places that are hospitable climates to their living.  According to some researchers, some of the species in North America has changed their average living ranges to the northern area in order to find more favourable areas. Needless to say, changes in ecosystems will have a detrimental effect on people's lives.

Finally, over 97% of scientists agree that human activities are the reason for causing a negative impact on the environment. Both government and individuals play important role in protecting the earth.

To sum up, I believe it is our responsibility to do what we can to save our planet so that both our offspring and animals can keep living on this planet.",6.5,,,
"Climate change has always been a debatable issue of countries leaders and a worldwide concern. Some people believe that global warming is unavoidable so that they must learn to live with it, instead of fighting against it. I completely disagree with this statement because the issue would bring about negative effects on the lives of humans and other species.

The elimination of global warming is crucial to the masses’ quality of lives because the phenomenon is diametrically harmful to the overall atmosphere. Air pollution would have a negative impact on the job performance and wellbeing of individuals, especially outdoor workers. Constructors or builders have to work under the scorching sun most of the days, therefore extremely hot or cold weather and polluted air considerably lower the task efficiency and the physical health of these workers. Moreover, there are situations where people pass out due to the extreme heat. Therefore, temperature change brings lots of consequences to the human body and life standards.

Another reason why we should aim to prevent global warming instead of ignoring it is to preserve biodiversity for endangered animals. As the climate is getting warmer, the icebergs from the North Poles would melt considerably and faster. This would push the life of polar bears and other species to the brink of extinction because their habitats are getting subsequentially smaller. As a matter of fact, the number of these cold-blooded animals would majorly decrease or they could die out from hunger. The near-extinction of these animals proves why we have to prevent this drastic issue as soon as possible.

In conclusion, living with global warming is never a sensible option due to the detrimental effects it causes to human and animal lives. I believe that everyone should be more responsible in tackling this global problem and finding possible solutions, rather than being ignorant.",6.5,,,
"Some people believe that we could live in an unpredictable environment which resulted from a global warming, whereas others argue that we should find a way to prevent climate change. I totally agree with the later statement. In this essay, I will give reasons to support my opinion, including examples from my experience.

Firstly, not only humans but also animals cannot survive in a harsh environment. Therefore, I think finding a way to live with it is wasting our time. In contrast, we should encourage communities to prevent climate change. For example, due to the global warming, the weather is getting hotter. Consequently, some people in Africa are suffering from it, and some of them died because they could not bare the weather. Another good example is that one cannot live without animals and plants. If the ecosystem of plants destroyed, it will definitely affect animals. Unfortunately, mankind will get the negative impact as well.

Secondly, even if protecting environment requires huge efforts from communities globally, it will lead to a powerful impact and a last longer solution. For instance, dwellers in Australia are confronting with bushfires every year. Australian alone could not prevent this problem, as the global warming need cooporate from everyone. In addition, rising of the weather one degree Celsius may cause some animals extinctions. Nevertheless, societies could stop this issue by pay more attention to adjust the way of living now, such as stop using plastic bags, reducing gas, etc.

In conclusion, people should immediately start prevent the climate change from today, since it will be getting worst in the future. Besides, I firmly agree that people should stop doing harmful things to the nature because this is the only way that we can live longer.",6.5,,,
"Today, no one will deny the importance of protecting the environment. Most scientists agree that global warming presents the greatest threat to the environment. 

There is little doubt that the  Earth is getting warmer. In the last ,century the average temperature rose about 0.6 degrees C around the world. Many experts warn that global warming will  cause sea levels to rise dramatically. In the last 100 ,years the oceans have risen 10 to 20 CMS which may cause some coastal areas with lower elevations may be submerged.

serious threat to animal and plant life,' says JayMalcolm, a forestry professor at the University of Toronto. As the climate warms, more southerly species will begin appearing further north, the species will find themselves in habitats where they don't belong.

However what just caused this series of changes? Just as the evidence is clear that temperatures have risen in the last century, it's also well established that carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere has increased about 30 per cent, allowing the atmosphere to trap too much heat. However, the exact link, if any, between the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and the higher temperatures is still being disputed. Most scientists believe that humans, by burning fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum, are largely to blame for the increase in carbon dioxide. But some scientists also point to natural causes, such as volcanic activity.

However, some people belive that rather stoping or being more cautious about climate change, we opt to find a suitable method to live with it. Personally speaking, I strongly disagree with this statement.

Others say that we should avoid fixing our planet's current state because global warming is a long-term issue that requires a lot of money to raise constant awareness and to resolve different issues, regards to this matter. Moreover, they think there are more vital and immediate issues that need more attention and investment than nature catastrophies, since they have not seen any servere effects yet. Let's not forget that, for the last two months, many Americans, especially people who lived in Texas suffered from snowfalls, which has never happened before so many residents lost their home, because they never experienced such events so theyr house cannot withstand the harsh conditions.

On the other hand of this issue, many argue that if we hesistant and do not start solving this problem because we might not see how serious the outcome can be, our younger generations need to suffer much more heavy consequences, which can be very difficult to control and resolve.

This has been the stance of the Republican party in the United States and its most notorious leaders such as former president Donald Trump.

On the other hand, the majority of the scientific community agrees that climate change is produced by greenhouse gas emissions and for this reason, the human species has the possibility of reversing the consequences of their actions over the planet.

Governments should make an investment in their nations' harnessing renewable energy sources like solar, wind or hydropower. To cite an example, Tesla is manufacturing cars running on solar and integrated renewable energy, which corroborates the world's transition to sustainable energy. Also, it is crucial for the authorities to impose strict laws on individuals' awareness of the environment and any individual who breaks the laws should be severely penalized to make an example for other citizens. As individuals, we should take endless perseverance to diminish our carbon footprints by using bicycles and walking rather than flying or driving cars.

On the other hand, when we succumb to climate change, it is synonymous with our confronting myriad natural calamities. To illustrate this, climate change is closely intertwined with global warming which is the culprit of rising sea levels, culminating in flooding in low-lying areas. Additionally, unpurified water penetration into human's bodies will lead to the outbreak of a plethora of fatal diseases. Natural calamities will deprive millions of people of their homes and their unalienable privileges. Climate change can wreak havoc on not only human but also the ecology of flora and fauna. The consequences of weather changes would be unprecedented. In the worst-case scenario, humans should prepare to terraform other habitable planets.

To recapitulate this, averting the upcoming climate change is very urgent,otherwise the survival of humans and animals will be put in jeopardy. We must make out best effort to save the Earth.",6.5,"Thus, the protection of the environment is vital and also  the prevention of destruction of human culture and population.: Fragment",,
"In the present world, environmental problems become more and more severe with increasing attention of  people. In this situation, some people reckon that we should adapt climate changes, rather than protecting the environment. From my perspective, I agree that human should prevent climate change. The following essay will prove this statement by discussing the negative consequence of only bearing the alter of weather and the true solution of climate change.

To begin with, the living circumstance will be much worse and even disastrous if people took no actions on restricting greenhouse gas emissions. Since there are growing needs for the fossil fuels that are using in various aspects such as car engine, plastic production and other necessary usages, the annual emissions of carbon dioxide will increase exponentially. As a result, the ice glacier will melt due to an increase in the temperature, leading to growth in the sea that will submerge coastal cities. Thus, the protection of the environment is vital and also  the prevention of destruction of human culture and population.

Moreover, the best method to resolve problems caused by climate change is to face the situations, instead of escaping. If people are more aware of the severity of greenhouse effects, it would reduce greenhouse gases exhausted by the car engine as more people opt to use public transportation. As the advancement of technology is rapid and Earth has the function to fix the ecosystem and environment problems, coping with the problems of weather is tangible and approachable. Therefore, the most suitable way is to restrict daily emissions until the cutting-edge technology has a breakthrough that can tackle the problems of climate change directly and effectively.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address climate change, and I disagree that people should find a way to live with it. I hope that the problems will be resolved as quickly as possible.",6.5,"Thus, the protection of the environment is vital and also  the prevention of destruction of human culture and population.: Fragment",,
"Addressing the constantly changing weather issue has long been a challenging task for many scientists. However, there are some who think that people should make adaptation to climate change in lieu of developing an approach to stopping the effects of it. In my opinion, I do not completely agree with this viewpoint because I believe it is not too late for us to deal with this problem.
To commence with, several measures could be taken by both Government and individuals to hinder climate change. Firstly, Government should incentivize people to use public transportations instead of private vehicles. This would decrease in the amount of vehicle exhaust which comprises a tremendous carbon footprint. As a consequence, the amount of carbon emissions would be reduced, contributing less to global warming which is a part of climate change. Secondly, people, as individuals, could utilize products made from non-plastic to reduce the amount of plastics. Plastics cannot be completely destroyed, it could remain beneath the earth and pollute the soil. Furthermore, when burning plastic-based products, a large carbon footprint would be dumped into the air. Therefore, by using non-plastic products such as paper bags or paper straws, we could limit the amount of carbon dioxide which leads to global warming.
Additionally, trying to live with climate change might lead to several disastrous repercussions. Take Australia as an example, there were forest fires which destroy a large area of Australia land and kill thousands of animals. This disaster is due to the considerable increase in the temperature which is unprecedented in the past. Another serious disaster is the high rainfall patterns in China, making Government release tons of water in hydroelectric dams. As a result, many houses and villages were destroyed, and thousands of people did not have the accommodations. Those disasters are due to the climate change. Therefore,  accepting and living with it is not a good idea.
In conclusion, although some may have opinions that people should try to adapt to climate change, I believe we should stop it.",6.5,,,
"Nowadays, hotly debated topic by many is alterations in climate and their impact on our planet.However, some argue that such changes are indispensable and humans have to cope with it by adopting various strategies.While some believe that avoidance is better than cure.In my view, finding new techniques to counter adverse climate conditions far outweigh the avoidance due to unstoppable factors.

On the one hand, the prime cause of this adverse climatic change is the uncontrolled population leading to  pollution resulting in global warming in the long run.A growing number of the population will utilize the natural resources like fossil fuels and oil for their transport and industrialization, which will result in rise of environmental temperature.So, there are abundance of methods being employed to counter this global warming either by ensuring strict laws on power plants, and use of public transport or check on privately own vehicles.For instance, The guardian reported in some article of march last year, that preventing climatic changes by forestation  help repairing of ozone layer significantly by more than 5%, thus having a positive impact on climate.It is, therefore, the ultimate responsibility of all mankind to ensure the things and measures which can prevent the climatic changes.

On the other hand, It is a bitter truth that we have to bear this global warming due to certain unavoidable factors, so everyone should take part positively in improving the climate of our planet.There are several techniques which can employ  on an individual level, which can cumulatively contribute better to atmospheric.Firstly, the modification of individual lifestyle, such as walking, exercise, less use of own vehicles, usage of bicycles.Secondly,improvement of public transport, maintenance of cleanliness and tree plantation are the key things to do.So there are countless ways to enhance the integrity of our atmosphere.For example,I was privileged enough to join a local community service club which taught me very comprehensively about environmental changes and their impact through various seminars and tutorials, which I consider the most beneficial in understanding the global warming  and the role of common citizens to counter it. Hence,numerous strategies can be used, in addition to, avoidance as well.

To recapitulate, although, avoidance can result in significant impact on the climate conditions, but, in addition to that, vital role of mankind by employing various methods cannot be denied.I consider, it should be encouraged through massive awareness for the betterment of our planet",6.5,"While some believe that avoidance is better than cure.: Fragment

"Many people, and child's particular enjoy playing computer games. While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.


On the one hand, video games can be both educational and entertaining. Users or gamers are transported to the virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than the real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage creativity and imagination, as well as concentration and logical thinking. All of which are useful skills outside the gaming context.  Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve user's motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks. 


On the other hand, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. First of all, gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and rewards keep them playing. Many children nowadays spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of the game to get higher scores than their friends. This will lead to the fact that children may face the lack of sleep and their homework, their performance in school may be dropped down. Furthermore, the rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that will be detrimental for children and their furture development 


To sum up, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits",6.5,,,
"The increasing attention concerning that global warming has becoming a common situation in the earth. However, one opinion indicates that the better solution is getting use to it. I totally disagree with this idea; there are two reasons to support my idea.

Firstly, the history of the earth has already proved that the climate changing could destroy a civilization. For instance, dinosaur became extinct in the ancient time because of they did not have any methods to predict the global disaster which is caused by climate changing. According the research, global warming could led to a sort of negative consequences, such as rising sea level and broken biological chain. Thus, we should never ignore that how our environment is important.

Another consideration in this case is that human being is the main responsibility taker of the global warming compare with other lives in this world. In many nations, the local government concentrated on developing the economy, people think establishing many industries is more important than protection of environment. As result, it led the serious carbon dioxide emission happened, and amount of animals lost their habitats even some species are facing the threat of extinct. Hence, we should clearly recognize that we should take the responsibility of protection of our planet instead of doing nothing, then we can make up those mistakes we have made.

In conclusion, as the most powerful lives in this world, we do have the ability to figure out this issue. We should reflect on our selves and to learn that how to have coexistence with nature.",6.5,"For instance, dinosaur became extinct in the ancient time because of they did not have any methods to predict the global disaster which is caused by climate changing.: Fragment",,
"Undoubtedly, these days, either people have to find a way to better weather conditions or adapt themselves in response to climate changes. It is often argued that people are able to adapt themselves to climate alterations, but it lasts for thousand years. I fully agree with this fact that it is better for people to remodel climate and not to try to reconcile themselves with this situation. In turn, this essay will discuss why preventing climate remodeling is better than adapting to this circumstance and the possible ways for people to alter climate.
    On the one hand, the more climate alters, the more life becomes harder. That is to say that people were able to suit themselves with the present climate within the millions of years, therefore humans cannot live easily with altered weather, while are able to quickly exchange their conditions lives. As a strategy, people can plant trees to decrease global warming, which nowadays is converted to a serious problem for governments. Trees are unthinkably capable to absorb the CO2 (carbon dioxide), which in high concentrations can damage human body cells and eventually leads to cell death. For instance, in forest countries, several kinds of cancers such as breast, brain, chest and stem cell cancers are extremely rare. In my opinion, enhancement of cultivated trees can secure the survival of planet Earth. To sum up, tree cultivation can help people to change the climate, significantly.    
    On the other hand, the more increased consumption of fossil fuels, the more altered climate. Approximately all scientists believe that consumption of fossil fuels increase the atmospheric pollutants as well as the weather temperature causing several damages to the environment such as increased melting icebergs and fires. For example, in the recent decade that the weather temperature of the world became warmer by up to 2 oC, the rate of fires over the world increased by up to 12%. Therefore, usage of fossil fuels is considered as the main agent of global warming. I believe that consumption of fossil fuels must be reduced by humans to decreased atmospheric pollutants happens. To take something into consideration, people have to decrease the consumption of fossil fuels, significantly. Alongside these contents, in some situations, people can adapt themselves with difficult environmental conditions not easily but hardly.
    Some people are of the opinion that modification of climate change can happen easily, while others are opposed to this view. I am sure that the enhancement of cultivated trees and reduction of consuming fossil fuels can help people to propel the climate changes to the desired side.",6.5,"That is to say that people were able to suit themselves with the present climate within the millions of years, therefore humans cannot live easily with altered weather, while are able to quickly exchange their conditions lives.: Fragment

"Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate.

There are various measures that governments and individuals could take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change. Governments could introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and they could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water power. As individuals, we should also try to limit our contribution to climate change, by becoming more energy efficient, by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport. Furthermore, the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change, rather than for those who would prefer to ignore it.

If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem of climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with it.",6.5,,,
"In recent decades, global warming has been receiving a great deal of media attention around the world due to its substantial impacts on human life. Although the idea of coexistence between climate change and humans appears reasonable, this cannot be viewed as the ultimate approach for humankind to combat climate change.
There are a number of reasons why the coexistence can do more harm than good. First, climate change is largely shaped by human-caused geoengineering rather than nature itself. For example, in order to produce the energy that drives the world’s economy, most nations rely on carbon- rich fuels like coal, oil and gas, which directly correlates with the intensification of global warming. Second, even if citizens agree to keep the environment the way it is, corporations, especially in the manufacturing and mining industries, would not as that would affect their profits. Therefore, it can be implied that if corporations were not held accountable for their contribution to global warming as in the case of coexistence, the issue of climate change would inevitably be exacerbated.
It is more economically sound to actively prevent climate change than to ignore it. In fact, the costs, either financial or non-financial, of dealing with future consequences of climate change can be overwhelming. For instance, the increase in intensity and frequency of storms can cause massive destructions and deaths in many coastal areas, which would take decades to recover. In addition, rising temperatures have also contributed to the extinction of species worldwide. It should be noted that the extinction is irreversible and comes at great cost to the ecosystem and apparently humans living within it.
In conclusion, actively combating global warming must be regarded as top priority given the high urgency. Governments and corporations worldwide should take steps to ensure that climate change remains at bay.",6.5,,,
"It is often an argued issue that money should spend on new buildings rather than of renovating the old buildings. New buildings can be lived a longer period to compared the old museums. I partially agree with this statement and that essay discusses it briefly for the following reasons. 

To commence with, certainly, capital should be spent on new museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones because these kinds of new museums can be lived a longer period, new modernized buildings can be built with a better interior design and all the amenities. In addition, these can be given enormous convenient to the population might be used happily.

Moreover, demolishing's building can be created numerous economic loss towards the nations. For instance, in western nation cannot demolish to their old bildings, besides, they can renovate old buildings. Hence, renovating is the best idea rather than building new ones.

"It is undeniable that most companies rely on interviews for hiring new employees, but some people believe that this dependence on interviews is wrong and that other alternatives should be preferred as they are better. I believe that interviews are a reliable method, and the other methods cannot be considered more effective.

There are many reasons why interviews are suitable for hiring new employees. Firstly, through the interview, the recruiters can get an idea about the personality and social skills of the potential employees. In interviews, there is face-to-face interaction, and the candidates have to answer impromptu questions, from which personality traits can be judged. Also, by asking some case study-type questions, employees can judge traits like the ability to handle pressure, confidence and the ability to think outside the box.

In addition, although there are many other methods for hiring, none of them could be considered superior to interviews. One the other common method is the written test, which is good to judge the theoretical knowledge of the person. However, this method cannot give a good idea about the personality of the candidate. By contrast, through interviews, employers can judge both the knowledge and temperament of the potential employee. Moreover, the written test is fallible to cheating as sometimes candidates can take outside help.

Another selection process is a group discussion, which is good where a major job requirement is conversational and persuasion skills for instance sales jobs. They are really not suited for technical jobs because these are not customer oriented. On the other hand, interviews hold good for any type of job as the interviewer can frame questions to test the particular skills they require.

To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the preference for interviews for hiring among employers is justified as interviews have advantages over other commonly adopted methods.",6.5,"""One the other common method is the written test, which is good to judge the theoretical knowledge of the person.""

"Interviews are commonly used as a way to screen candidates at large companies. However, some people argue that interviews are not an effective way to recruit employees. I agree that relying on interviews alone can lead to hiring the wrong professional. However, I believe that when used in combination with other assessment methods, such as group activities and quizzes, interviews can be a valuable tool in the hiring process.

 

Organisations are increasingly using group activities to assess applicants’ suitability for their roles. This allows them to see how potential employees react under pressure and how they handle conflict. These simulations give organisations a better understanding of the professional’s values, behaviours and thinking patterns. As candidates often lie in the interview and tend to act like robots answering the questions the way the recruiter expects, the information gathered in the group work can then be used alongside interview results to make final hiring decisions.

 

Secondly, personality quizzes can be a useful tool for assessing job seekers' profiles and determining their strengths and weaknesses. Such tests can help to identify which aspirants are naturally good mediators and which ones will require more direction from others. If one of the criteria for the role is to hire someone with strong leadership skills, then mediators may be the best option. 

 

In conclusion,  it's important to remember that no single method is perfect and that interviews are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to recruiting.

"As the economy is advancing by leaps and bounds, the attitude people adopt towards recruitment has undergone a noticeable and far-reaching transformation. Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether there are other effective alternatives to interviews which have been fundamental choosing standards. For my part, I side with the advocates to a larger extent based on the following sound reasons.

Firstly, it is noteworthy that conversations fail to make a comprehensive assessment of job-seekers. Nowadays, many studies have shown that although it is invisible, the meeting in person can not make the evaluation of the honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness of applicants because of limited interaction in a short period of time. Therefore, it will be a grave mistake to overlook the fact that interviews are not the most dependable method for recruitment. For example, in some countries where employers give high weight to whole-life employment, reference from current employees is widely applied to recruit new staff rather than public advertisement and interviews. This example is the illustration of the fact that talking is not a totally reliable method for some inherited shortcomings.

Secondly, the counter-argument raised by objectors is that without meeting job-seekers can not show off their abilities, and experiences. This belief could be attributed to the fact that in large measure, conversations have been widely used to check the richness of capabilities such as interpersonal interaction skills, resilience and critical thinking skill via giving questions and requiring immediate answers. This argument is true to some degree; however, it is incomplete, what they fail to take into account is that meetings can not go further to check criminal records or bank credit. For instance, according to some research, when it comes to fulfilling vacancies for managers, directors, and chief officers; most companies are inclined to use services provided by head-hunting companies because these companies are specialized in seeking highly qualified workers with special tools, professional means.

In conclusion, I am convinced that there are more productive methods to recruit new personnel than interviews for the reasons mentioned above. From this point, people need to prepare a good quality thoroughly to achieve their career target and successfully pass all the company's criteria.",6.5,"""Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether there are other effective alternatives to interviews which have been fundamental choosing standards."": fragment ""This argument is true to some degree; however, it is incomplete, what they fail to take into account is that meetings can not go further to check criminal records or bank credit."": run-on",,
"Different eminent companies think interview is a satisfaction method for basic selection. However, there are those who say that interview is not a perfect system of choosing employees as well as there are other better methods. I completely believe that interview process is the best way in this essay. I will examine my point of view. 

Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why I believe that phenomenon. Perhaps the main reason is that communication skill, confidence and group working mentality can be understood by taking interview. Moreover, some people do not feel comfortable when they communicate with others. For example, in sales and marketing job workers should have good communication skills to persuade customers by giving advertise about their product. Furthermore, in multinational job, people have to do work in a group.there may have foreign people. so in that case, communication is the most crucial skill. 

Another reason why I believe with this statement is that fundamental skill. there are some company where workers need basic skill and good knowledge about their sector. In addition, the owner can check their portfolio and ask basic questions by face to face interview. For instance, in it related job, the workers need basic cognition in programming. If they have this learning, , they have to have a good portfolio and LinkedIn ID .So the holder of the company can check it.
